        "abstract": "In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to describe the evolution of the concentration of compounds through a gas chromatography column. The model couples mass balances and kinetic equations for all components. Both single and multiple-component cases are considered with constant or variable velocity. Non-dimensionalisation indicates the small effect of diffusion. The system where diffusion is neglected is analysed using Laplace transforms. In the multiple-component case, it is demonstrated that the competition between the compounds is negligible and the equations may be decoupled. This reduces the problem to solving a single integral equation to determine the concentration profile for all components (since they are scaled versions of each other). For a given analyte, we then only two parameters need to be fitted to the data. To verify this approach, the full governing equations are also solved numerically using the finite difference method and a global adaptive quadrature method to integrate the Laplace transformation. Comparison with the Laplace solution verifies the high degree of accuracy of the simpler Laplace form. The Laplace solution is then verified against experimental data from BTEX chromatography. This novel method, which involves solving a single equation and fitting parameters in pairs for individual components, is highly efficient. It is significantly faster and simpler than the full numerical solution and avoids the computationally expensive methods that would normally be used to fit all curves at the same time.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), discrete speech representations have become crucial for integrating speech into LLMs. Existing methods for speech representation discretization rely on a predefined codebook size and Euclidean distance-based quantization. However, 1) the size of codebook is a critical parameter that affects both codec performance and downstream task training efficiency. 2) The Euclidean distance-based quantization may lead to audio distortion when the size of the codebook is controlled within a reasonable range. In fact, in the field of information compression, structural information and entropy guidance are crucial, but previous methods have largely overlooked these factors. Therefore, we address the above issues from an information-theoretic perspective, we present SECodec, a novel speech representation codec based on structural entropy (SE) for building speech language models. Specifically, we first model speech as a graph, clustering the speech features nodes within the graph and extracting the corresponding codebook by hierarchically and disentangledly minimizing 2D SE. Then, to address the issue of audio distortion, we propose a new quantization method. This method still adheres to the 2D SE minimization principle, adaptively selecting the most suitable token corresponding to the cluster for each incoming original speech node. Furthermore, we develop a Structural Entropy-based Speech Language Model (SESLM) that leverages SECodec. Experimental results demonstrate that SECodec performs comparably to EnCodec in speech reconstruction, and SESLM surpasses VALL-E in zero-shot text-to-speech tasks. Code, demo speeches, speech feature graph, SE codebook, and models are available at https://github.com/wlq2019/SECodec.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the way we think about language understanding and generation, enthralling both researchers and developers. However, deploying LLMs for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented size and resource requirements. While quantizing model weights to sub-byte precision has emerged as a promising solution to ease memory pressure, the group quantization formats commonly used for LLM quantization have significant compute overheads and a resource-intensive dequantization process. As a result, a higher proportion of compute instructions do not perform multiplies, i.e., real work, rendering them unsuitable for meeting the required latency requirements for LLMs deployed on commodity CPUs. In this work, we propose a set of highly optimized kernels to accelerate LLM inference and unleash the full potential of CPUs, particularly Arm CPUs. These kernels amortize the cost of loading the operands and the cost of weight unpacking across multiple output rows. This, along with the introduction of an optimized interleaved group data layout for weights and decompression path optimizations to reduce unnecessary operations and dequantization overhead while maximizing the use of vector and matrix multiply operations, significantly improves the efficiency of MAC operations. Furthermore, we present a groupwise non-uniform codebook-based quantization method for ultra-low-precision quantization of LLMs to better match non-uniform patterns in their weight distributions, demonstrating better throughput during token generation while ensuring better quality than the state-of-the-art. Applying these improvements to 4-bit LLMs results in a 3-3.2x improvement in prompt processing and a 2x improvement in autoregressive decoding on Arm CPUs, compared to http://LLaMA.cpp-based solution.

However, the development of DT models often faces challenges such as high data requirements, integration complexity, and limited adaptability to dynamic changes in physical systems. This paper presents a new method inspired by dynamic data-driven applications systems (DDDAS), called the dynamic data-driven generative of digital twins framework (DDD-GenDT), which combines the physical system with LLM, allowing LLM to act as DT to interact with the physical system operating status and generate the corresponding physical behaviors. We apply DDD-GenDT to the computer numerical control (CNC) machining process, and we use the spindle current measurement data in the NASA milling wear data set as an example to enable LLMs to forecast the physical behavior from historical data and interact with current observations. Experimental results show that in the zero-shot prediction setting, the LLM-based DT can adapt to the change in the system, and the average RMSE of the GPT-4 prediction is 0.479A, which is 4.79% of the maximum spindle motor current measurement of 10A, with little training data and instructions required. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of DDD-GenDT in this specific application and their potential to construct digital twins. We also discuss the limitations and challenges that may arise in practical implementations.",

In this paper, we systematically analyze the impact of diverse text anchors on unlearning performance.

Researching attack methods allows us to better understand the limitations of LLM and make trade-offs between helpfulness and safety. However, existing jailbreak attacks are primarily based on opaque optimization techniques (e.g. token-level gradient descent) and heuristic search methods like LLM refinement, which fall short in terms of transparency, transferability, and computational cost. In light of these limitations, we draw inspiration from the evolution and infection processes of biological viruses and propose LLM-Virus, a jailbreak attack method based on evolutionary algorithm, termed evolutionary jailbreak. LLM-Virus treats jailbreak attacks as both an evolutionary and transfer learning problem, utilizing LLMs as heuristic evolutionary operators to ensure high attack efficiency, transferability, and low time cost. Our experimental results on multiple safety benchmarks show that LLM-Virus achieves competitive or even superior performance compared to existing attack methods.",

However, given the open-ended nature of LLMs, e.g., their ability to in-context learn, we can ask whether models alter these pretraining semantics to adopt alternative, context-specified ones. Specifically, if we provide in-context exemplars wherein a concept plays a different role than what the pretraining data suggests, do models reorganize their representations in accordance with these novel semantics? To answer this question, we take inspiration from the theory of conceptual role semantics and define a toy \"graph tracing\" task wherein the nodes of the graph are referenced via concepts seen during training (e.g., apple, bird, etc.) and the connectivity of the graph is defined via some predefined structure (e.g., a square grid). Given exemplars that indicate traces of random walks on the graph, we analyze intermediate representations of the model and find that as the amount of context is scaled, there is a sudden re-organization from pretrained semantic representations to in-context representations aligned with the graph structure. Further, we find that when reference concepts have correlations in their semantics (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.), the context-specified graph structure is still present in the representations, but is unable to dominate the pretrained structure. To explain these results, we analogize our task to energy minimization for a predefined graph topology, providing evidence towards an implicit optimization process to infer context-specified semantics. Overall, our findings indicate scaling context-size can flexibly re-organize model representations, possibly unlocking novel capabilities.",

We collect 25.6K U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) opinions and their official summaries, known as \"syllabuses.\" Our dataset is the largest open legal case summarization dataset, and is the first to include summaries of SCOTUS decisions dating back to 1815.\nWe also present a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-generated summaries using both automatic metrics and expert human evaluation, revealing discrepancies between these assessment methods. Our evaluation shows Mistral 7b, a smaller open-source model, outperforms larger models on most automatic metrics and successfully generates syllabus-like summaries. In contrast, human expert annotators indicate that Mistral summaries contain hallucinations. The annotators consistently rank GPT-4 summaries as clearer and exhibiting greater sensitivity and specificity. Further, we find that LLM-based evaluations are not more correlated with human evaluations than traditional automatic metrics. Furthermore, our analysis identifies specific hallucinations in generated summaries, including precedent citation errors and misrepresentations of case facts. These findings demonstrate the limitations of current automatic evaluation methods for legal summarization and highlight the critical role of human evaluation in assessing summary quality, particularly in complex, high-stakes domains.\nCaseSumm is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChicagoHAI/CaseSumm",

        "abstract": "We introduce LTX-Video, a transformer-based latent diffusion model that adopts a holistic approach to video generation by seamlessly integrating the responsibilities of the Video-VAE and the denoising transformer. Unlike existing methods, which treat these components as independent, LTX-Video aims to optimize their interaction for improved efficiency and quality. At its core is a carefully designed Video-VAE that achieves a high compression ratio of 1:192, with spatiotemporal downscaling of 32 x 32 x 8 pixels per token, enabled by relocating the patchifying operation from the transformer's input to the VAE's input. Operating in this highly compressed latent space enables the transformer to efficiently perform full spatiotemporal self-attention, which is essential for generating high-resolution videos with temporal consistency. However, the high compression inherently limits the representation of fine details. To address this, our VAE decoder is tasked with both latent-to-pixel conversion and the final denoising step, producing the clean result directly in pixel space. This approach preserves the ability to generate fine details without incurring the runtime cost of a separate upsampling module. Our model supports diverse use cases, including text-to-video and image-to-video generation, with both capabilities trained simultaneously. It achieves faster-than-real-time generation, producing 5 seconds of 24 fps video at 768x512 resolution in just 2 seconds on an Nvidia H100 GPU, outperforming all existing models of similar scale. The source code and pre-trained models are publicly available, setting a new benchmark for accessible and scalable video generation.",

Alt text plays a critical role in enabling visually impaired users to understand visual content through assistive technologies. However, generating high-quality alt text at scale is a resource-intensive process, creating significant challenges for organizations aiming to ensure accessibility compliance. This paper introduces AltGen, a novel AI-driven pipeline designed to automate the generation of alt text for images in EPUB files. By integrating state-of-the-art generative models, including advanced transformer-based architectures, AltGen achieves contextually relevant and linguistically coherent alt text descriptions. The pipeline encompasses multiple stages, starting with data preprocessing to extract and prepare relevant content, followed by visual analysis using computer vision models such as CLIP and ViT. The extracted visual features are enriched with contextual information from surrounding text, enabling the fine-tuned language models to generate descriptive and accurate alt text. Validation of the generated output employs both quantitative metrics, such as cosine similarity and BLEU scores, and qualitative feedback from visually impaired users.\nExperimental results demonstrate the efficacy of AltGen across diverse datasets, achieving a 97.5% reduction in accessibility errors and high scores in similarity and linguistic fidelity metrics. User studies highlight the practical impact of AltGen, with participants reporting significant improvements in document usability and comprehension. Furthermore, comparative analyses reveal that AltGen outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, relevance, and scalability.",

Recently, diffusion models and autoregressive models have demonstrated their outstanding expressivity and gradually replaced GAN as the favored architectures for text-to-image synthesis. However, they still face some obstacles: slow inference speed and expensive training costs. To achieve more powerful and faster text-to-image synthesis under complex scenes, we propose TIGER, a text-to-image GAN with pretrained representations. To be specific, we propose a vision-empowered discriminator and a high-capacity generator. (i) The vision-empowered discriminator absorbs the complex scene understanding ability and the domain generalization ability from pretrained vision models to enhance model performance. Unlike previous works, we explore stacking multiple pretrained models in our discriminator to collect multiple different representations. (ii) The high-capacity generator aims to achieve effective text-image fusion while increasing the model capacity. The high-capacity generator consists of multiple novel high-capacity fusion blocks (HFBlock). And the HFBlock contains several deep fusion modules and a global fusion module, which play different roles to benefit our model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our proposed TIGER both on standard and zero-shot text-to-image synthesis tasks. On the standard text-to-image synthesis task, TIGER achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging datasets, which obtain a new FID 5.48 (COCO) and 9.38 (CUB). On the zero-shot text-to-image synthesis task, we achieve comparable performance with fewer model parameters, smaller training data size and faster inference speed. Additionally, more experiments and analyses are conducted in the Supplementary Material.",

For 49 SE tasks, LLM-generated warm starts significantly improved the performance of low- and medium-dimensional tasks.

Scenarios and benchmarks have been developed in several areas such as law, medicine and math (Bommasani et al., 2023) and there is continuous evaluation of model variants. One area that has not received sufficient scenario development attention is journalism, and in particular journalistic sourcing and ethics. Journalism is a crucial truth-determination function in democracy (Vincent, 2023), and sourcing is a crucial pillar to all original journalistic output. Evaluating the capacities of LLMs to annotate stories for the different signals of sourcing and how reporters justify them is a crucial scenario that warrants a benchmark approach. It offers potential to build automated systems to contrast more transparent and ethically rigorous forms of journalism with everyday fare. In this paper we lay out a scenario to evaluate LLM performance on identifying and annotating sourcing in news stories on a five-category schema inspired from journalism studies (Gans, 2004). We offer the use case, our dataset and metrics and as the first step towards systematic benchmarking. Our accuracy findings indicate LLM-based approaches have more catching to do in identifying all the sourced statements in a story, and equally, in matching the type of sources. An even harder task is spotting source justifications.",

        "abstract": "Image content safety has become a significant challenge with the rise of visual media on online platforms. Meanwhile, in the age of AI-generated content (AIGC), many image generation models are capable of producing harmful content, such as images containing sexual or violent material. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify such unsafe images based on established safety rules. Pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential in this regard, given their strong pattern recognition abilities. Existing approaches typically fine-tune MLLMs with human-labeled datasets, which however brings a series of drawbacks. First, relying on human annotators to label data following intricate and detailed guidelines is both expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore, users of safety judgment systems may need to frequently update safety rules, making fine-tuning on human-based annotation more challenging. This raises the research question: Can we detect unsafe images by querying MLLMs in a zero-shot setting using a predefined safety constitution (a set of safety rules)? Our research showed that simply querying pre-trained MLLMs does not yield satisfactory results. This lack of effectiveness stems from factors such as the subjectivity of safety rules, the complexity of lengthy constitutions, and the inherent biases in the models. To address these challenges, we propose a MLLM-based method includes objectifying safety rules, assessing the relevance between rules and images, making quick judgments based on debiased token probabilities with logically complete yet simplified precondition chains for safety rules, and conducting more in-depth reasoning with cascaded chain-of-thought processes if necessary. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is highly effective for zero-shot image safety judgment tasks.",

We examine the model's ability to classify patient interviews into binary categories: depressed and not depressed. A comparative analysis is conducted considering prompt complexity (e.g., using both simple and complex prompts) as well as varied temperature settings to assess the impact of prompt complexity and randomness on the model's performance.\nResults indicate that GPT-4 exhibits considerable variability in accuracy and F1-Score across configurations, with optimal performance observed at lower temperature values (0.0-0.2) for complex prompts. However, beyond a certain threshold (temperature >= 0.3), the relationship between randomness and performance becomes unpredictable, diminishing the gains from prompt complexity.\nThese findings suggest that, while GPT-4 shows promise for clinical assessment, the configuration of the prompts and model parameters requires careful calibration to ensure consistent results. This preliminary study contributes to understanding the dynamics between prompt engineering and large language models, offering insights for future development of AI-powered tools in clinical settings.",

This study makes the following two key contributions: First, we propose generative EmCom as a novel framework for understanding emergent communication, demonstrating how communication emergence in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can be derived from control as inference while clarifying its relationship to conventional discriminative approaches. Second, we propose a mathematical formulation showing the interpretation of LLMs as collective world models that integrate multiple agents' experiences through CPC. The framework provides a unified theoretical foundation for understanding how shared symbol systems emerge through collective predictive coding processes, bridging individual cognitive development and societal language evolution.

Polynomial regression analyses capture foundational and incremental impacts of these hyperparameters, focusing on fine-tuning adjustments relative to a baseline model.\nResults reveal variability in metrics due to hyperparameter configurations, showing trade-offs among performance metrics. For example, a higher learning rate reduces loss in relative analysis (p=0.027) but challenges accuracy improvements. Meanwhile, batch size significantly impacts accuracy and F1-score in absolute regression (p=0.028 and p=0.005) but has limited influence on loss optimization (p=0.170). The interaction between epochs and batch size maximizes F1-score (p=0.001), underscoring the importance of hyperparameter interplay.\nThese findings highlight the need for fine-tuning strategies addressing non-linear hyperparameter interactions to balance performance across metrics. Such variability and metric trade-offs are relevant for tasks beyond text classification, including NLP and computer vision.

While traditional FGIR deals with classifying different species, UFGIR goes beyond by classifying sub-categories within a species such as cultivars of a plant. In recent times the usage of Vision Transformer-based backbones has allowed methods to obtain outstanding recognition performances in this task but this comes at a significant cost in terms of computation specially since this task significantly benefits from incorporating higher resolution images. Therefore, techniques such as token reduction have emerged to reduce the computational cost. However, dropping tokens leads to loss of essential information for fine-grained categories, specially as the token keep rate is reduced. Therefore, to counteract the loss of information brought by the usage of token reduction we propose a novel Cross-Layer Aggregation Classification Head and a Cross-Layer Cache mechanism to recover and access information from previous layers in later locations. Extensive experiments covering more than 2000 runs across diverse settings including 5 datasets, 9 backbones, 7 token reduction methods, 5 keep rates, and 2 image sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed plug-and-play modules and allow us to push the boundaries of accuracy vs cost for UFGIR by reducing the kept tokens to extremely low ratios of up to 10\\% while maintaining a competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art models.

However, the lack of factual accuracy is still a dark cloud hanging over the LLM skyscraper. Structural knowledge prompting (SKP) is a prominent paradigm to integrate external knowledge into LLMs by incorporating structural representations, achieving state-of-the-art results in many knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing methods often focus on specific problems, lacking a comprehensive exploration of the generalization and capability boundaries of SKP. This paper aims to evaluate and rethink the generalization capability of the SKP paradigm from four perspectives including Granularity, Transferability, Scalability, and Universality. To provide a thorough evaluation, we introduce a novel multi-granular, multi-level benchmark called SUBARU, consisting of 9 different tasks with varying levels of granularity and difficulty.",

        "abstract": "Despite the remarkable coherence of Large Language Models (LLMs), existing evaluation methods often suffer from fluency bias and rely heavily on multiple-choice formats, making it difficult to assess factual accuracy and complex reasoning effectively. LLMs thus frequently generate factually inaccurate responses, especially in complex reasoning tasks, highlighting two prominent challenges: (1) the inadequacy of existing methods to evaluate reasoning and factual accuracy effectively, and (2) the reliance on human evaluators for nuanced judgment, as illustrated by Williams and Huckle (2024)[1], who found manual grading indispensable despite automated grading advancements.\nTo address evaluation gaps in open-ended reasoning tasks, we introduce the EQUATOR Evaluator (Evaluation of Question Answering Thoroughness in Open-ended Reasoning). This framework combines deterministic scoring with a focus on factual accuracy and robust reasoning assessment. Using a vector database, EQUATOR pairs open-ended questions with human-evaluated answers, enabling more precise and scalable evaluations. In practice, EQUATOR significantly reduces reliance on human evaluators for scoring and improves scalability compared to Williams and Huckle's (2004)[1] methods.\nOur results demonstrate that this framework significantly outperforms traditional multiple-choice evaluations while maintaining high accuracy standards. Additionally, we introduce an automated evaluation process leveraging smaller, locally hosted LLMs. We used LLaMA 3.2B, running on the Ollama binaries to streamline our assessments. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating LLM performance, emphasizing factual accuracy and reasoning ability, and provides a robust methodological foundation for future research.",

By exploiting the unique structure of the particle system and a spherical Brownian motion sampling, the method avoids additional temporal discretization of the particle system, ensuring that the discrete-time particle distributions exactly match their continuous-time counterparts. The method achieves $O(N)$ complexity per time step and preserves fundamental physical properties, including the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, as well as entropy dissipation.

We examine two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, on story generation and discover that LLM-generated stories often consist of plot elements that are echoed across a number of generations. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Sui Generis score, which estimates how unlikely a plot element is to appear in alternative storylines generated by the same LLM. Evaluating on 100 short stories, we find that LLM-generated stories often contain combinations of idiosyncratic plot elements echoed frequently across generations, while the original human-written stories are rarely recreated or even echoed in pieces. Moreover, our human evaluation shows that the ranking of Sui Generis scores among story segments correlates moderately with human judgment of surprise level, even though score computation is completely automatic without relying on human judgment.",

Inspired by the multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT) and recent advances in discrete diffusion language modeling, we leverage a cross-modal maximum likelihood estimation framework that simultaneously trains the conditional likelihoods of both images and text jointly under a single loss function, which is back-propagated through both branches of the diffusion transformer. The resulting model is highly flexible and capable of a wide range of tasks including image generation, captioning, and visual question answering. Our model attained competitive performance compared to recent unified image understanding and generation models, demonstrating the potential of multimodal diffusion modeling as a promising alternative to autoregressive next-token prediction models.",

        "abstract": "Spatiotemporal prediction over graphs (STPG) is challenging, because real-world data suffers from the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where test data follow different distributions from training ones. To address this issue, Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) has emerged as a promising approach for learning invariant representations across different environments. However, IRM and its variants are originally designed for Euclidean data like images, and may not generalize well to graph-structure data such as spatiotemporal graphs due to spatial correlations in graphs. To overcome the challenge posed by graph-structure data, the existing graph OOD methods adhere to the principles of invariance existence, or environment diversity. However, there is little research that combines both principles in the STPG problem. A combination of the two is crucial for efficiently distinguishing between invariant features and spurious ones. In this study, we fill in this research gap and propose a diffusion-augmented invariant risk minimization (diffIRM) framework that combines these two principles for the STPG problem. Our diffIRM contains two processes: i) data augmentation and ii) invariant learning. In the data augmentation process, a causal mask generator identifies causal features and a graph-based diffusion model acts as an environment augmentor to generate augmented spatiotemporal graph data. In the invariant learning process, an invariance penalty is designed using the augmented data, and then serves as a regularizer for training the spatiotemporal prediction model. The real-world experiment uses three human mobility datasets, i.e. SafeGraph, PeMS04, and PeMS08. Our proposed diffIRM outperforms baselines.",

However, their ability in location or map-based reasoning - which improves daily life by optimizing navigation, facilitating resource discovery, and streamlining logistics - has not been systematically studied. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapEval, a benchmark designed to assess diverse and complex map-based user queries with geo-spatial reasoning. MapEval features three task types (textual, API-based, and visual) that require collecting world information via map tools, processing heterogeneous geo-spatial contexts (e.g., named entities, travel distances, user reviews or ratings, images), and compositional reasoning, which all state-of-the-art foundation models find challenging. Comprising 700 unique multiple-choice questions about locations across 180 cities and 54 countries, MapEval evaluates foundation models' ability to handle spatial relationships, map infographics, travel planning, and navigation challenges. Using MapEval, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 28 prominent foundation models. While no single model excelled across all tasks, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Gemini-1.5-Pro achieved competitive performance overall. However, substantial performance gaps emerged, particularly in MapEval, where agents with Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperformed GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro by 16% and 21%, respectively, and the gaps became even more amplified when compared to open-source LLMs. Our detailed analyses provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of current models, though all models still fall short of human performance by more than 20% on average, struggling with complex map images and rigorous geo-spatial reasoning. This gap highlights MapEval's critical role in advancing general-purpose foundation models with stronger geo-spatial understanding.",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by incorporating external, real-time information retrieval to ground LLM responses.

To tackle this problem, we propose Multi-Agent Filtering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MAIN-RAG), a training-free RAG framework that leverages multiple LLM agents to collaboratively filter and score retrieved documents. Specifically, MAIN-RAG introduces an adaptive filtering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the relevance filtering threshold based on score distributions, effectively minimizing noise while maintaining high recall of relevant documents. The proposed approach leverages inter-agent consensus to ensure robust document selection without requiring additional training data or fine-tuning. Experimental results across four QA benchmarks demonstrate that MAIN-RAG consistently outperforms traditional RAG approaches, achieving a 2-11% improvement in answer accuracy while reducing the number of irrelevant retrieved documents. Quantitative analysis further reveals that our approach achieves superior response consistency and answer accuracy over baseline methods, offering a competitive and practical alternative to training-based solutions.",

We introduce SG-Splatting with Spherical Gaussians based color representation, a novel approach to enhance rendering speed and quality in novel view synthesis. Our method first represents view-dependent color using Spherical Gaussians, instead of three degree spherical harmonics, which largely reduces the number of parameters used for color representation, and significantly accelerates the rendering process. We then develop an efficient strategy for organizing multiple Spherical Gaussians, optimizing their arrangement to achieve a balanced and accurate scene representation. To further improve rendering quality, we propose a mixed representation that combines Spherical Gaussians with low-degree spherical harmonics, capturing both high- and low-frequency color information effectively. SG-Splatting also has plug-and-play capability, allowing it to be easily integrated into existing systems. This approach improves computational efficiency and overall visual fidelity, making it a practical solution for real-time applications.",

However, existing Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods generally focus on either geometric or semantic reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce PanoSLAM, the first SLAM system to integrate geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation within a unified framework. Our approach builds upon 3D Gaussian Splatting, modified with several critical components to enable efficient rendering of depth, color, semantic, and instance information from arbitrary viewpoints. To achieve panoptic 3D scene reconstruction from sequential RGB-D videos, we propose an online Spatial-Temporal Lifting (STL) module that transfers 2D panoptic predictions from vision models into 3D Gaussian representations. This STL module addresses the challenges of label noise and inconsistencies in 2D predictions by refining the pseudo labels across multi-view inputs, creating a coherent 3D representation that enhances segmentation accuracy. Our experiments show that PanoSLAM outperforms recent semantic SLAM methods in both mapping and tracking accuracy. For the first time, it achieves panoptic 3D reconstruction of open-world environments directly from the RGB-D video. (https://github.com/runnanchen/PanoSLAM)",

To address these limitations, we propose RAG-Instruct, a general method for synthesizing diverse and high-quality RAG instruction data based on any source corpus. Our approach leverages (1) five RAG paradigms, which encompass diverse query-document relationships, and (2) instruction simulation, which enhances instruction diversity and quality by utilizing the strengths of existing instruction datasets. Using this method, we construct a 40K instruction dataset from Wikipedia, comprehensively covering diverse RAG scenarios and tasks. Experiments demonstrate that RAG-Instruct effectively enhances LLMs' RAG capabilities, achieving strong zero-shot performance and significantly outperforming various RAG baselines across a diverse set of tasks.

        "abstract": "Privacy computing receives increasing attention but writing privacy computing code remains challenging for developers due to limited library functions that necessitate extensive function implementation from scratch as well as the data-oblivious requirement which contradicts intuitive thinking and usual practices of programmers. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated surprising capabilities in coding tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performance across many benchmarks. However, even with extensive prompting, existing LLMs struggle with code translation task for privacy computing, such as translating Python to MP-SPDZ, due to the scarcity of MP-SPDZ data required for effective pre-training or fine-tuning. To address the limitation, this paper proposes SPDZCoder, a rule-based framework to teach LLMs to synthesize privacy computing code without asking experts to write tons of code and by leveraging the instruction-following and in-context learning ability of LLMs. Specifically, SPDZCoder decouples the translation task into the refactoring stage and the generation stage, which can mitigate the semantic-expressing differences at different levels. In addition, SPDZCoder can further improve its performance by a feedback stage. SPDZCoder does not require fine-tuning since it adopts an in-context learning paradigm of LLMs. To evaluate SPDZCoder, we manually created a benchmark dataset, named SPDZEval, containing six classes of difficult tasks to implement in MP-SPDZ. We conduct experiments on SPDZEval and the experimental results shows that SPDZCoder achieves the state-of-the-art performance in pass@1 and pass@2 across six data splits. Specifically, SPDZCoder achieves an overall correctness of 85.94% and 92.01% in pass@1 and pass@2, respectively, significantly surpassing baselines (at most 30.35% and 49.84% in pass@1 and pass@2, respectively) by a large margin.",

However, its iterative denoising introduces high computational costs and slows generation speed, limiting broader adoption. The community has made numerous efforts to reduce this computational burden, with methods like feature caching attracting attention due to their effectiveness and simplicity. Nonetheless, simply reusing features computed at previous timesteps causes the features across adjacent timesteps to become similar, reducing the dynamics of features over time and ultimately compromising the quality of generated images. In this paper, we introduce a dynamics-aware token pruning (DaTo) approach that addresses the limitations of feature caching. DaTo selectively prunes tokens with lower dynamics, allowing only high-dynamic tokens to participate in self-attention layers, thereby extending feature dynamics across timesteps. DaTo combines feature caching with token pruning in a training-free manner, achieving both temporal and token-wise information reuse. Applied to Stable Diffusion on the ImageNet, our approach delivered a 9$\\times$ speedup while reducing FID by 0.33, indicating enhanced image quality. On the COCO-30k, we observed a 7$\\times$ acceleration coupled with a notable FID reduction of 2.17.",

To address this, we propose S-Diff, inspired by graph-based collaborative filtering, better to utilize low-frequency components in the graph spectral domain. S-Diff maps user interaction vectors into the spectral domain and parameterizes diffusion noise to align with graph frequency. This anisotropic diffusion retains significant low-frequency components, preserving a high signal-to-noise ratio. S-Diff further employs a conditional denoising network to encode user interactions, recovering true preferences from noisy data. This method achieves strong results across multiple datasets.",

To address this, link prediction or knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer missing new facts based on existing facts in KGs. Previous knowledge graph embedding models are limited in their ability to capture expressive features, especially when compared to deeper, multi-layer models. These approaches also assign a single static embedding to each entity and relation, disregarding the fact that entities and relations can exhibit different behaviors in varying graph contexts. Due to complex context over a fact triple of a KG, existing methods have to leverage complex non-linear context encoder, like transformer, to project entity and relation into low dimensional representations, resulting in high computation cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose Triple Receptance Perception (TRP) architecture to model sequential information, enabling the learning of dynamic context of entities and relations. Then we use tensor decomposition to calculate triple scores, providing robust relational decoding capabilities. This integration allows for more expressive representations. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as YAGO3-10, UMLS, FB15k, and FB13 in link prediction and triple classification tasks demonstrate that our method performs better than several state-of-the-art models, proving the effectiveness of the integration.",

A key phenomenon known as weak-to-strong generalization - where a strong model trained on a weak model's outputs surpasses the weak model in task performance - has gained significant attention. Yet, whether critical trustworthiness properties such as robustness, fairness, and privacy can generalize similarly remains an open question. In this work, we study this question by examining if a stronger model can inherit trustworthiness properties when fine-tuned on a weaker model's outputs, a process we term weak-to-strong trustworthiness generalization. To address this, we introduce two foundational training strategies: 1) Weak Trustworthiness Finetuning (Weak TFT), which leverages trustworthiness regularization during the fine-tuning of the weak model, and 2) Weak and Weak-to-Strong Trustworthiness Finetuning (Weak+WTS TFT), which extends regularization to both weak and strong models. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets reveals that while some trustworthiness properties, such as fairness, adversarial, and OOD robustness, show significant improvement in transfer when both models were regularized, others like privacy do not exhibit signs of weak-to-strong trustworthiness. As the first study to explore trustworthiness generalization via weak-to-strong generalization, our work provides valuable insights into the potential and limitations of weak-to-strong generalization.",

The remarkable progress in text-to-image diffusion model presents the potential to resolve this task by employing synthetic image-caption pairs generated by this pre-trained prior. Nonetheless, the defective details in the salient regions of the synthetic images introduce semantic misalignment between the synthetic image and text, leading to compromised results. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Patch-wise Cross-modal feature Mix-up (PCM) mechanism to adaptively mitigate the unfaithful contents in a fine-grained manner during training, which can be integrated into most of encoder-decoder frameworks, introducing our PCM-Net. Specifically, for each input image, salient visual concepts in the image are first detected considering the image-text similarity in CLIP space. Next, the patch-wise visual features of the input image are selectively fused with the textual features of the salient visual concepts, leading to a mixed-up feature map with less defective content. Finally, a visual-semantic encoder is exploited to refine the derived feature map, which is further incorporated into the sentence decoder for caption generation. Additionally, to facilitate the model training with synthetic data, a novel CLIP-weighted cross-entropy loss is devised to prioritize the high-quality image-text pairs over the low-quality counterparts. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30k datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PCM-Net compared with state-of-the-art VLMs-based approaches.

Both systems were designed based on adversarial networks to generate music by learning from examples. The classical system was trained to learn a set of music pieces without differentiating between classes, whereas the new system was trained to learn the different composers and their styles to generate a creative music piece by deviating from the learned composers' styles.\nThe base structure utilized was generative adversarial networks (GANs), which are capable of generating novel outputs given a set of inputs to learn from and mimic their distribution. It has been shown in previous work that GANs are limited in their original design with respect to creative outputs. Building on the Creative Adversarial Networks (CAN) , this work applied them in the music domain rather than the visual art domain. Additionally, unrolled CAN was introduced to prevent mode collapse. Experiments were conducted on both GAN and CAN for generating music, and their capabilities were measured in terms of deviation from the input set.",

Continuous prompts parameterize context tokens in prompts by turning them into differentiable vectors. Deep continuous prompts insert prompts not only in the input but also in the intermediate hidden representations. Manually designed deep continuous prompts exhibit a remarkable improvement compared to the zero-shot pre-trained model on downstream tasks. How to automate the continuous prompt design is an underexplored area, and a fundamental question arises, is manually designed deep prompt strategy optimal? To answer this question, we propose a method dubbed differentiable prompt learning (DPL). The DPL method is formulated as an optimization problem to automatically determine the optimal context length of the prompt to be added to each layer, where the objective is to maximize the performance. We test the DPL method on the pre-trained CLIP. We empirically find that by using only limited data, our DPL method can find deep continuous prompt configuration with high confidence. The performance on the downstream tasks exhibits the superiority of the automatic design: our method boosts the average test accuracy by 2.60% on 11 datasets compared to baseline methods. Besides, our method focuses only on the prompt configuration (i.e. context length for each layer), which means that our method is compatible with the baseline methods that have sophisticated designs to boost the performance. The DPL method can be deployed to large language models or computer vision models at no cost.",

However, the effectiveness of these models is constrained by challenges in data quality and model generalization including imbalanced datasets, limited diversity and annotation variability. These issues reduce diagnostic reliability and hinder real-world applicability.\nThis article provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges and their implications for malaria detection performance. Key findings highlight the impact of data imbalances which can lead to a 20\\% drop in F1-score and regional biases which significantly hinder model generalization. Proposed solutions, such as GAN-based augmentation, improved accuracy by 15-20\\% by generating synthetic data to balance classes and enhance dataset diversity. Domain adaptation techniques, including transfer learning, further improved cross-domain robustness by up to 25\\% in sensitivity.\nAdditionally, the development of diverse global datasets and collaborative data-sharing frameworks is emphasized as a cornerstone for equitable and reliable malaria diagnostics. The role of explainable AI techniques in improving clinical adoption and trustworthiness is also underscored. By addressing these challenges, this work advances the field of AI-driven malaria detection and provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners. The proposed solutions aim to support the development of accessible and accurate diagnostic tools, particularly for resource-constrained populations.",

While traditional score-based diffusion models excel in accurately learning the score function from data points, they lack an energy function, making the Metropolis-Hastings adjustment step inaccessible. Consequently, the unadjusted Langevin algorithm is often used for sampling using estimated score functions. The lack of an energy function then prevents the application of the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm and other Metropolis-Hastings methods, limiting the wealth of other algorithms developed that use acceptance functions. We address this limitation by introducing a new loss function based on the \\emph{detailed balance condition}, allowing the estimation of the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities given a learned score function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for various scenarios, including sampling from heavy-tail distributions.",

To address this problem, we present FIBER, a FIne-grained BEnchmark for text to video Retrieval, containing 1,000 videos sourced from the FineAction dataset. Uniquely, our FIBER benchmark provides detailed human-annotated spatial annotations and temporal annotations for each video, making it possible to independently evaluate the spatial and temporal bias of VLMs on video retrieval task. Besides, we employ a text embedding method to unlock the capability of fine-grained video-language understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Surprisingly, the experiment results show that our Video Large Language Encoder (VLLE) performs comparably to CLIP-based models on traditional benchmarks and has a stronger capability of fine-grained representation with lower spatial-temporal bias.

In this study, our focus is on Romanized Sinhala transliteration. We propose two methods to address this problem: Our baseline is a rule-based method, which is then compared against our second method where we approach the transliteration problem as a sequence-to-sequence task akin to the established Neural Machine Translation (NMT) task. For the latter, we propose a Transformer-based Encode-Decoder solution. We witnessed that the Transformer-based method could grab many ad-hoc patterns within the Romanized scripts compared to the rule-based method.

However, they often make overconfident, incorrect predictions, which can be risky in high-stakes settings like healthcare and finance. To mitigate these risks, recent works have used conformal prediction (CP), a model-agnostic framework for distribution-free uncertainty quantification. CP transforms a \\emph{score function} into prediction sets that contain the true answer with high probability. While CP provides this coverage guarantee for arbitrary scores, the score quality significantly impacts prediction set sizes. Prior works have relied on LLM logits or other heuristic scores, lacking quality guarantees. We address this limitation by introducing CP-OPT, an optimization framework to learn scores that minimize set sizes while maintaining coverage. Furthermore, inspired by the Monty Hall problem, we extend CP's utility beyond uncertainty quantification to improve accuracy. We propose \\emph{conformal revision of questions} (CROQ) to revise the problem by narrowing down the available choices to those in the prediction set. The coverage guarantee of CP ensures that the correct choice is in the revised question prompt with high probability, while the smaller number of choices increases the LLM's chances of answering it correctly. Experiments on MMLU, ToolAlpaca, and TruthfulQA datasets with Gemma-2, Llama-3 and Phi-3 models show that CP-OPT significantly reduces set sizes while maintaining coverage, and CROQ improves accuracy over the standard inference, especially when paired with CP-OPT scores. Together, CP-OPT and CROQ offer a robust framework for improving both the safety and accuracy of LLM-driven decision-making.",

Given that many LLMs are multilingual, relying solely on benchmarking English knowledge is insufficient. To address this issue, we introduce AraSTEM, a new Arabic multiple-choice question dataset aimed at evaluating LLMs knowledge in STEM subjects. The dataset spans a range of topics at different levels which requires models to demonstrate a deep understanding of scientific Arabic in order to achieve high accuracy.

Due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of human evaluations, an automatic LLM bencher (i.e., an automatic evaluation framework that aims to rank LLMs based on their alignment with human preferences) is indispensable. An automatic LLM bencher consists of four components: the input set (e.g., a user instruction), the evaluation model (e.g., an LLM), the evaluation type (e.g., pairwise comparison), and the aggregation method (e.g., the ELO rating system). However, previous work has not thoroughly explored how to select these components or how their different combinations influence the results. In this work, through controlled experiments, we provide a series of recommendations on how to choose each component to better automate the evaluation of LLMs. Furthermore, we discovered that when evaluating LLMs with similar performance, the performance of the automatic LLM bencher declines sharply, underscoring the limitations of current benchers and calling for future work. Lastly, we found that the evaluation models' performance at the instance level (e.g., the accuracy of selecting the best output) does not always align with their effectiveness when used as a component of a bencher, highlighting the importance of dedicated system-level evaluation of benchers.",

By leveraging image generative models, we ensure significant variation in texture, shape, conceptual combinations, hallucinated elements, and proverb-based contexts, making our benchmark images distinctly out-of-distribution. While humans achieve near-perfect accuracy, modern VLMs falter; for instance, GPT-4 achieves only 66.17% on ViLP. To alleviate this, we propose a self-improving framework in which models generate new VQA pairs and images, then apply pixel-level and semantic corruptions to form \"good-bad\" image pairs for self-training.

This paper introduces a novel system for sidewalk safety navigation utilizing a hybrid approach that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM). The system is designed to detect anomalies on sidewalks that could potentially pose walking hazards. A dataset comprising over 15,000 training frames and 5,000 testing frames was collected using video recordings, capturing various sidewalk scenarios, including normal and hazardous conditions. During deployment, the VAE utilizes its reconstruction mechanism to detect anomalies within a frame. Poor reconstruction by the VAE implies the presence of an anomaly, after which the OCSVM is used to confirm whether the anomaly is hazardous or non-hazardous. The proposed VAE model demonstrated strong performance, with a high Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.94, effectively distinguishing anomalies that could be potential hazards. The OCSVM is employed to reduce the detection of false hazard anomalies, such as manhole or water valve covers. This approach achieves an accuracy of 91.4%, providing a highly reliable system for distinguishing between hazardous and non-hazardous scenarios. These results suggest that the proposed system offers a robust solution for hazard detection in uncertain environments.",

        "abstract": "Language models have made remarkable advancements in understanding and generating human language, achieving notable success across a wide array of applications. However, evaluating these models remains a significant challenge, particularly for resource-limited languages such as Turkish. To address this gap, we introduce the Turkish MMLU (TR-MMLU) benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework designed to assess the linguistic and conceptual capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in Turkish. TR-MMLU is constructed from a carefully curated dataset comprising 6200 multiple-choice questions across 62 sections, selected from a pool of 280000 questions spanning 67 disciplines and over 800 topics within the Turkish education system. This benchmark provides a transparent, reproducible, and culturally relevant tool for evaluating model performance. It serves as a standard framework for Turkish NLP research, enabling detailed analyses of LLMs' capabilities in processing Turkish text and fostering the development of more robust and accurate language models. In this study, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on TR-MMLU, providing insights into their strengths and limitations for Turkish-specific tasks. Our findings reveal critical challenges, such as the impact of tokenization and fine-tuning strategies, and highlight areas for improvement in model design. By setting a new standard for evaluating Turkish language models, TR-MMLU aims to inspire future innovations and support the advancement of Turkish NLP research.",

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in tackling a wide array of graph-related tasks across diverse domains. However, a significant challenge lies in their propensity to generate biased predictions, particularly with respect to sensitive node attributes such as age and gender. These biases, inherent in many machine learning models, are amplified in GNNs due to the message-passing mechanism, which allows nodes to influence each other, rendering the task of making fair predictions notably challenging. This issue is particularly pertinent in critical domains where model fairness holds paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a novel generative Fairness-Aware Subgraph Diffusion (FASD) method for unbiased GNN learning. The method initiates by strategically sampling small subgraphs from the original large input graph, and then proceeds to conduct subgraph debiasing via generative fairness-aware graph diffusion processes based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs). To effectively diffuse unfairness in the input data, we introduce additional adversary bias perturbations to the subgraphs during the forward diffusion process, and train score-based models to predict these applied perturbations, enabling them to learn the underlying dynamics of the biases present in the data. Subsequently, the trained score-based models are utilized to further debias the original subgraph samples through the reverse diffusion process. Finally, FASD induces fair node predictions on the input graph by performing standard GNN learning on the debiased subgraphs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art Fair GNN baselines across multiple benchmark datasets.",

        "abstract": "Synthesizing photo-realistic visual observations from an ego vehicle's driving trajectory is a critical step towards scalable training of self-driving models. Reconstruction-based methods create 3D scenes from driving logs and synthesize geometry-consistent driving videos through neural rendering, but their dependence on costly object annotations limits their ability to generalize to in-the-wild driving scenarios. On the other hand, generative models can synthesize action-conditioned driving videos in a more generalizable way but often struggle with maintaining 3D visual consistency. In this paper, we present DreamDrive, a 4D spatial-temporal scene generation approach that combines the merits of generation and reconstruction, to synthesize generalizable 4D driving scenes and dynamic driving videos with 3D consistency. Specifically, we leverage the generative power of video diffusion models to synthesize a sequence of visual references and further elevate them to 4D with a novel hybrid Gaussian representation. Given a driving trajectory, we then render 3D-consistent driving videos via Gaussian splatting. The use of generative priors allows our method to produce high-quality 4D scenes from in-the-wild driving data, while neural rendering ensures 3D-consistent video generation from the 4D scenes. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and street view images demonstrate that DreamDrive can generate controllable and generalizable 4D driving scenes, synthesize novel views of driving videos with high fidelity and 3D consistency, decompose static and dynamic elements in a self-supervised manner, and enhance perception and planning tasks for autonomous driving.",

        "abstract": "We present STORM, a spatio-temporal reconstruction model designed for reconstructing dynamic outdoor scenes from sparse observations. Existing dynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense observations across space and time, and strong motion supervision, resulting in lengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel views or scenes, and degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for dynamics. To address these challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven Transformer architecture that directly infers dynamic 3D scene representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians and their velocities--in a single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate 3D Gaussians from all frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming them to the target timestep to enable complete (i.e., \"amodal\") reconstructions from arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM automatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks using only reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that STORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and existing feed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions. STORM reconstructs large-scale outdoor scenes in 200ms, supports real-time rendering, and outperforms competitors in scene flow estimation, improving 3D EPE by 0.422m and Acc5 by 28.02%. Beyond reconstruction, we showcase four additional applications of our model, illustrating the potential of self-supervised learning for broader dynamic scene understanding.",

Recently, these models have shifted from traditional U-Shaped CNN-Attention hybrid structures to fully transformer-based isotropic architectures. While these transformers exhibit strong scalability and performance, their reliance on complicated self-attention operation results in slow inference speeds. Contrary to these works, we rethink one of the simplest yet fastest module in deep learning, 3x3 Convolution, to construct a scaled-up purely convolutional diffusion model. We first discover that an Encoder-Decoder Hourglass design outperforms scalable isotropic architectures for Conv3x3, but still under-performing our expectation. Further improving the architecture, we introduce sparse skip connections to reduce redundancy and improve scalability. Based on the architecture, we introduce conditioning improvements including stage-specific embeddings, mid-block condition injection, and conditional gating. These improvements lead to our proposed Diffusion CNN (DiC), which serves as a swift yet competitive diffusion architecture baseline. Experiments on various scales and settings show that DiC surpasses existing diffusion transformers by considerable margins in terms of performance while keeping a good speed advantage.

These computational challenges are compounded when training transformers due to the self-attention operator, which scales quadratically with context length.

In this study, we investigate the impact of context length on biomedical image analysis and we evaluate the performance of recently proposed long-context models. We first curate a suite of biomedical imaging datasets, including 2D and 3D data for segmentation, denoising, and classification tasks. We then analyze the impact of context length on network performance using the Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer by varying patch size and attention window size. Our findings reveal a strong relationship between context length and performance, particularly for pixel-level prediction tasks. Finally, we show that recent long-context models demonstrate significant improvements in efficiency while maintaining comparable performance, though we highlight where gaps remain.

In this work, we show that existing feed-forward reconstruction methods can serve as effective latent encoders for training 3D generative models, thereby bridging these two paradigms. By reusing powerful pre-trained reconstruction models, we avoid computationally expensive encoder network training and obtain rich 3D latent features for generative modeling for free. However, the latent spaces of reconstruction models are not well-suited for generative modeling due to their unstructured nature. To enable flow-based model training on these latent features, we develop post-processing pipelines, including protocols to standardize the features and spatial weighting to concentrate on important regions. We further incorporate a 2D image space perceptual rendering loss to handle the high-dimensional latent spaces. Finally, we propose a multi-stream transformer-based rectified flow architecture to achieve linear scaling and high-quality text-conditioned 3D generation.

The majority of effort has been expended on validating that a compiler produces correct code for a given input, while less attention has been paid to ensuring that the compiler produces performant code.\nIn this work we adapt differential testing to the task of identifying missed optimization opportunities in compilers. We develop a novel testing approach which combines large language models (LLMs) with a series of differential testing strategies and use them to find missing code size optimizations in C / C++ compilers.\nThe advantage of our approach is its simplicity. We offload the complex task of generating random code to an off-the-shelf LLM, and use heuristics and analyses to identify anomalous compiler behavior. Our approach requires fewer than 150 lines of code to implement. This simplicity makes it extensible. By simply changing the target compiler and initial LLM prompt we port the approach from C / C++ to Rust and Swift, finding bugs in both. To date we have reported 24 confirmed bugs in production compilers, and conclude that LLM-assisted testing is a promising avenue for detecting optimization bugs in real world compilers.",

OLMo 2 includes dense autoregressive models with improved architecture and training recipe, pretraining data mixtures, and instruction tuning recipes. Our modified model architecture and training recipe achieve both better training stability and improved per-token efficiency. Our updated pretraining data mixture introduces a new, specialized data mix called Dolmino Mix 1124, which significantly improves model capabilities across many downstream task benchmarks when introduced via late-stage curriculum training (i.e. specialized data during the annealing phase of pretraining). Finally, we incorporate best practices from Tülu 3 to develop OLMo 2-Instruct, focusing on permissive data and extending our final-stage reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Our OLMo 2 base models sit at the Pareto frontier of performance to compute, often matching or outperforming open-weight only models like Llama 3.1 and Qwen 2.5 while using fewer FLOPs and with fully transparent training data, code, and recipe. Our fully open OLMo 2-Instruct models are competitive with or surpassing open-weight only models of comparable size, including Qwen 2.5, Llama 3.1 and Gemma 2. We release all OLMo 2 artifacts openly -- models at 7B and 13B scales, both pretrained and post-trained, including their full training data, training code and recipes, training logs and thousands of intermediate checkpoints. The final instruction model is available on the Ai2 Playground as a free research demo.",

While SSMs are often regarded as effective in capturing long-sequence dependencies, we rigorously demonstrate that they are inherently limited by strong recency bias. Our empirical studies also reveal that this bias impairs the models' ability to recall distant information and introduces robustness issues. Our scaling experiments then discovered that deeper structures in SSMs can facilitate the learning of long contexts. However, subsequent theoretical analysis reveals that as SSMs increase in depth, they exhibit another inevitable tendency toward over-smoothing, e.g., token representations becoming increasingly indistinguishable. This fundamental dilemma between recency and over-smoothing hinders the scalability of existing SSMs. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we propose to polarize two channels of the state transition matrices in SSMs, setting them to zero and one, respectively, simultaneously addressing recency bias and over-smoothing. Experiments demonstrate that our polarization technique consistently enhances the associative recall accuracy of long-range tokens and unlocks SSMs to benefit further from deeper architectures.

The answer is \"no\" as long as they have more than one layer -- they can distinguish sequences with permuted tokens without requiring explicit PEs. This property has been known since early efforts (those contemporary with GPT-2) adopting the Transformer for language modeling. However, this result does not appear to have been well disseminated and was even rediscovered recently. This may be partially due to a sudden growth of the language modeling community after the advent of GPT-2, but perhaps also due to the lack of a clear explanation in prior publications, despite being commonly understood by practitioners in the past. Here we review this long-forgotten explanation why explicit PEs are nonessential for multi-layer autoregressive Transformers (in contrast, one-layer models require PEs to discern order information of their input tokens). We also review the origin of this result, and hope to re-establish it as a common knowledge.",

Our approach takes only a single iteration to run and requires no external tools. It performs arithmetic operations entirely inside the LLM without the need to produce intermediate tokens.

In contrast to the widely studied prompt engineering for task solving directly (in vivo), this paper explores its potential in in-vitro applications. These involve using LLM to generate labels to help the supervised training of mainstream models by (1) noisy label correction and (2) training data augmentation with LLM-generated labels. In this paper, we evaluate this approach in the emerging field of empathy computing -- automating the prediction of psychological questionnaire outcomes from inputs like text sequences. Specifically, crowdsourced datasets in this domain often suffer from noisy labels that misrepresent underlying empathy. By leveraging LLM-generated labels to train pre-trained language models (PLMs) like RoBERTa, we achieve statistically significant accuracy improvements over baselines, achieving a state-of-the-art Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.648 on NewsEmp benchmarks. In addition, we bring insightful discussions, including current challenges in empathy computing, data biases in training data and evaluation metric selection.

Existing methods fall back to training LLMs with short contexts (a maximum of a few thousands tokens in training) and use inference time techniques when evaluating on long contexts (above 1M tokens context window at inference). As opposed to long-context-inference, training on very long context input prompts is quickly limited by GPU memory availability and by the prohibitively long training times it requires on state-of-the-art hardware. Meanwhile, many real-life applications require not only inference but also training/fine-tuning with long context on specific tasks. Such applications include, for example, augmenting the context with various sources of raw reference information for fact extraction, fact summarization, or fact reconciliation tasks. We propose adjoint sharding, a novel technique that comprises sharding gradient calculation during training to reduce memory requirements by orders of magnitude, making training on very long context computationally tractable. Adjoint sharding is based on the adjoint method and computes equivalent gradients to backpropagation. We also propose truncated adjoint sharding to speed up the algorithm while maintaining performance. We provide a distributed version, and a paralleled version of adjoint sharding to further speed up training. Empirical results show the proposed adjoint sharding algorithm reduces memory usage by up to 3X with a 1.27B parameter large language model on 1M context length training. This allows to increase the maximum context length during training or fine-tuning of a 1.27B parameter model from 35K tokens to above 100K tokens on a training infrastructure composed of five AWS P4 instances.",

To address these issues, we propose a novel knowledge-guided prompt learning method for deepfake facial image detection. Specifically, we retrieve forgery-related prompts from large language models as expert knowledge to guide the optimization of learnable prompts. Besides, we elaborate test-time prompt tuning to alleviate the domain shift, achieving significant performance improvement and boosting the application in real-world scenarios.

They are an additive model with an embedding that is independent of the function of interest. They provide an alternative to the transformer architecture. They are the machine learning version of Kolmogorov's Superposition Theorem (KST) which provides an efficient representations of a multivariate function. Such representations have use in machine learning for encoding dictionaries (a.k.a. \"look-up\" tables). KST theory also provides a representation based on translates of the Köppen function. The goal of our paper is to interpret this representation in a machine learning context for applications in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our architecture is equivalent to a topological embedding which is independent of the function together with an additive layer that uses a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). This provides a class of learning procedures with far fewer parameters than current deep learning algorithms. Implementation can be parallelizable which makes our algorithms computationally attractive. To illustrate our methodology, we use the Iris data from statistical learning. We also show that our additive model with non-linear embedding provides an alternative to transformer architectures which from a statistical viewpoint are kernel smoothers. Additive KAN models therefore provide a natural alternative to transformers. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.",

Our primary objective is to evaluate whether pruned BERT models can maintain high performance while reducing model size and complexity. We experiment with several BERT variants, including MahaBERT-v2 and Google-Muril, applying different pruning strategies and comparing their performance to smaller, scratch-trained models like MahaBERT-Small and MahaBERT-Smaller. We fine-tune these models on Marathi datasets, specifically Short Headlines Classification (SHC), Long Paragraph Classification (LPC) and Long Document Classification (LDC), to assess their classification accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that pruned models, despite having fewer layers, achieve comparable performance to their fully-layered counterparts while consistently outperforming scratch-trained models of similar size. Notably, pruning layers from the middle of the model proves to be the most effective strategy, offering performance competitive with pruning from the top and bottom. However, there is no clear winner, as different pruning strategies perform better in different model and dataset combinations. Additionally, monolingual BERT models outperform multilingual ones in these experiments. This approach, which reduces computational demands, provides a faster and more efficient alternative to training smaller models from scratch, making advanced NLP models more accessible for low-resource languages without compromising classification accuracy.",

Such issues are mainly caused by the lack of high-quality paired training data, as well as the self-supervised training paradigm adopted in these methods, which forces the model to in-paint the masked regions, leading to ambiguity between synthesizing the masked objects and restoring the background. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised learning strategy with human-in-the-loop to create high-quality paired training data, aiming to train a Robust Object Remover (RORem). We first collect 60K training pairs from open-source datasets to train an initial object removal model for generating removal samples, and then utilize human feedback to select a set of high-quality object removal pairs, with which we train a discriminator to automate the following training data generation process. By iterating this process for several rounds, we finally obtain a substantial object removal dataset with over 200K pairs. Fine-tuning the pre-trained stable diffusion model with this dataset, we obtain our RORem, which demonstrates state-of-the-art object removal performance in terms of both reliability and image quality. Particularly, RORem improves the object removal success rate over previous methods by more than 18\\%.

Additionally, data resources are scarce, particularly high-quality datasets with complete sign vocabulary and pose annotations. To address these issues, we introduce CNText2Sign and CNSign, comprehensive datasets to benchmark SLP and SLT, respectively, with CNText2Sign covering gloss and landmark mappings for SLP, and CNSign providing extensive video-to-text data for SLT. To improve the accuracy and applicability of sign language systems, we propose the AuraLLM and SignMST-C models. AuraLLM, incorporating LoRA and RAG techniques, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 50.41 on the CNText2Sign dataset, enabling precise control over gesture semantics and motion. SignMST-C employs self-supervised rapid motion video pretraining, achieving a BLEU-4 score of 31.03/32.08 on the PHOENIX2014-T benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art. These models establish robust baselines for the datasets released for their respective tasks.",

In this paper, we first introduce ZeroCF, a faithful approach for leveraging important words derived from feature attribution methods to generate counterfactual examples in a zero-shot setting. Second, we present a new framework, FitCF, which further verifies aforementioned counterfactuals by label flip verification and then inserts them as demonstrations for few-shot prompting, outperforming two state-of-the-art baselines. Through ablation studies, we identify the importance of each of FitCF's core components in improving the quality of counterfactuals, as assessed through flip rate, perplexity, and similarity measures. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of LIME and Integrated Gradients as backbone attribution methods for FitCF and find that the number of demonstrations has the largest effect on performance. Finally, we reveal a strong correlation between the faithfulness of feature attribution scores and the quality of generated counterfactuals.",

To address the limitations of large-scale language models (e.g., GPT-4) in capturing intricate emotional causality within extended dialogues, we propose CauseMotion, a long-sequence emotional causal reasoning framework grounded in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multimodal fusion. Unlike conventional methods relying only on textual information, CauseMotion enriches semantic representations by incorporating audio-derived features-vocal emotion, emotional intensity, and speech rate-into textual modalities. By integrating RAG with a sliding window mechanism, it effectively retrieves and leverages contextually relevant dialogue segments, thus enabling the inference of complex emotional causal chains spanning multiple conversational turns. To evaluate its effectiveness, we constructed the first benchmark dataset dedicated to long-sequence emotional causal reasoning, featuring dialogues with over 70 turns. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RAG-based multimodal integrated approach, the efficacy of substantially enhances both the depth of emotional understanding and the causal inference capabilities of large-scale language models. A GLM-4 integrated with CauseMotion achieves an 8.7% improvement in causal accuracy over the original model and surpasses GPT-4o by 1.2%.

These novel methods aim for better generalization and scalability for more sizable graphs but face significant challenges, such as (1) inability to handle unknown diffusion patterns and (2) reliance on high-quality training samples. To address these issues, we propose the Reinforced Expert Maximization framework (REM). REM leverages a Propagation Mixture of Experts technique to encode dynamic propagation of large multiplex networks effectively in order to generate enhanced influence propagation. Noticeably, REM treats a generative model as a policy to autonomously generate different seed sets and learn how to improve them from a Reinforcement Learning perspective.

Large Language Models (LLMs) provide high-quality and explicit distribution, which is an available mathematical tool for secure steganography methods. However, existing attempts fail to achieve high capacity, time efficiency and correctness simultaneously, and their strongly coupling designs leave little room for refining them to achieve better performance. To provide a secure, high-capacity and efficient steganography method, we introduce ShiMer. Specifically, ShiMer pseudorandomly shifts the probability interval of the LLM's distribution to obtain a private distribution, and samples a token according to the private bits. ShiMer produced steganographic texts are indistinguishable in quality from the normal texts directly generated by the language model. To further enhance the capacity of ShiMer, we design a reordering algorithm to minimize the occurrence of interval splitting during decoding phase. Experimental results indicate that our method achieves the highest capacity and efficiency among existing secure steganography techniques.",

Traditional approaches, which primarily rely on recurrent units or Transformer layers to capture long-term dependencies, often fall short in addressing these challenges. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their robust sequential modeling capabilities and extensive commonsense knowledge, present new opportunities for long-term action anticipation. In this work, we introduce the ActionLLM framework, a novel approach that treats video sequences as successive tokens, leveraging LLMs to anticipate future actions. Our baseline model simplifies the LLM architecture by setting future tokens, incorporating an action tuning module, and reducing the textual decoder layer to a linear layer, enabling straightforward action prediction without the need for complex instructions or redundant descriptions. To further harness the commonsense reasoning of LLMs, we predict action categories for observed frames and use sequential textual clues to guide semantic understanding. In addition, we introduce a Cross-Modality Interaction Block, designed to explore the specificity within each modality and capture interactions between vision and textual modalities, thereby enhancing multimodal tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ActionLLM framework, encouraging a promising direction to explore LLMs in the context of action anticipation.

In this work, we present an alternative approach that projects facial images as points on the latent space of a pre-trained GAN, which are then optimized to produce beautiful faces.

Event cameras, on the other hand, provide high-temporal-resolution motion cues and excel in challenging scenarios. These complementary characteristics underscore the potential of integrating frame and event data for optical flow estimation. However, most cross-modal approaches fail to fully utilize the complementary advantages, relying instead on simply stacking information. This study introduces a novel approach that uses a spatially dense modality to guide the aggregation of the temporally dense event modality, achieving effective cross-modal fusion. Specifically, we propose an event-enhanced frame representation that preserves the rich texture of frames and the basic structure of events. We use the enhanced representation as the guiding modality and employ events to capture temporally dense motion information. The robust motion features derived from the guiding modality direct the aggregation of motion information from events. To further enhance fusion, we propose a transformer-based module that complements sparse event motion features with spatially rich frame information and enhances global information propagation. Additionally, a mix-fusion encoder is designed to extract comprehensive spatiotemporal contextual features from both modalities. Extensive experiments on the MVSEC and DSEC-Flow datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Leveraging the complementary strengths of frames and events, our method achieves leading performance on the DSEC-Flow dataset. Compared to the event-only model, frame guidance improves accuracy by 10\\%.

Existing benchmarks focus on classical cognitive illusions, which have been learned by state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, revealing issues such as hallucinations and limited perceptual abilities. To address this gap, we introduce IllusionBench, a comprehensive visual illusion dataset that encompasses not only classic cognitive illusions but also real-world scene illusions. This dataset features 1,051 images, 5,548 question-answer pairs, and 1,051 golden text descriptions that address the presence, causes, and content of the illusions. We evaluate ten SOTA VLMs on this dataset using true-or-false, multiple-choice, and open-ended tasks. In addition to real-world illusions, we design trap illusions that resemble classical patterns but differ in reality, highlighting hallucination issues in SOTA models. The top-performing model, GPT-4o, achieves 80.59% accuracy on true-or-false tasks and 76.75% on multiple-choice questions, but still lags behind human performance. In the semantic description task, GPT-4o's hallucinations on classical illusions result in low scores for trap illusions, even falling behind some open-source models. IllusionBench is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest and most comprehensive benchmark for visual illusions in VLMs to date.",

Existing simultaneous generation methods generally adopt the traditional encoder-decoder architecture and learn the generation and policy-making capabilities through complex dynamic programming techniques. Although LLMs excel at text generation, they face challenges in taking on the role of policy-makers through traditional training methods, limiting their exploration in simultaneous generation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-driven Simultaneous Generation (LSG) framework, which allows the off-the-shelf LLM to decide the generation timing and produce output concurrently. Specifically, LSG selects the generation policy that minimizes latency as the baseline policy. Referring to the baseline policy, LSG enables the LLM to devise an improved generation policy that better balances latency and generation quality, and writes generation results accordingly. Experiments on simultaneous translation and streaming automatic speech recognition tasks show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance utilizing the open-source LLMs and demonstrate practicality in real-world scenarios.",

LUSIFER's architecture combines a multilingual encoder, serving as a language-universal learner, with an LLM-based embedding model optimized for embedding-specific tasks. These components are seamlessly integrated through a minimal set of trainable parameters that act as a connector, effectively transferring the multilingual encoder's language understanding capabilities to the specialized embedding model. Additionally, to comprehensively evaluate multilingual embedding performance, we introduce a new benchmark encompassing 5 primary embedding tasks, 123 diverse datasets, and coverage across 14 languages.

A common solution is to leverage powerful vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to bridge the gap between vision and text information. However, VLMs are typically pretrained for image-level vision-text alignment, focusing on global semantic features. In contrast, segmentation tasks require fine-grained pixel-level alignment and detailed category boundary information, which VLMs alone cannot provide. As a result, information extracted directly from VLMs can't meet the requirements of segmentation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose FGAseg, a model designed for fine-grained pixel-text alignment and category boundary supplementation. The core of FGAseg is a Pixel-Level Alignment module that employs a cross-modal attention mechanism and a text-pixel alignment loss to refine the coarse-grained alignment from CLIP, achieving finer-grained pixel-text semantic alignment. Additionally, to enrich category boundary information, we introduce the alignment matrices as optimizable pseudo-masks during forward propagation and propose Category Information Supplementation module. These pseudo-masks, derived from cosine and convolutional similarity, provide essential global and local boundary information between different categories. By combining these two strategies, FGAseg effectively enhances pixel-level alignment and category boundary information, addressing key challenges in open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FGAseg outperforms existing methods on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation benchmarks.",

However, these systems remain vulnerable to corpus poisoning attacks that can significantly degrade LLM performance through the injection of malicious content. To address these challenges, we propose TrustRAG, a robust framework that systematically filters compromised and irrelevant content before it reaches the language model. Our approach implements a two-stage defense mechanism: first, it employs K-means clustering to identify potential attack patterns in retrieved documents based on their semantic embeddings, effectively isolating suspicious content. Second, it leverages cosine similarity and ROUGE metrics to detect malicious documents while resolving discrepancies between the model's internal knowledge and external information through a self-assessment process. TrustRAG functions as a plug-and-play, training-free module that integrates seamlessly with any language model, whether open or closed-source, maintaining high contextual relevance while strengthening defenses against attacks. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that TrustRAG delivers substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy, efficiency, and attack resistance compared to existing approaches across multiple model architectures and datasets.

However, the existing methods primarily transfer the LLM architecture to visual generation but rarely investigate the fundamental differences between language and vision. This oversight may lead to suboptimal utilization of visual generation capabilities within the LLM framework. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of visual embedding space under the LLM framework and discover that the correlation between visual embeddings can help achieve more stable and robust generation results. We present IAR, an Improved AutoRegressive Visual Generation Method that enhances the training efficiency and generation quality of LLM-based visual generation models. Firstly, we propose a Codebook Rearrangement strategy that uses balanced k-means clustering algorithm to rearrange the visual codebook into clusters, ensuring high similarity among visual features within each cluster. Leveraging the rearranged codebook, we propose a Cluster-oriented Cross-entropy Loss that guides the model to correctly predict the cluster where the token is located. This approach ensures that even if the model predicts the wrong token index, there is a high probability the predicted token is located in the correct cluster, which significantly enhances the generation quality and robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the model training efficiency and performance from 100M to 1.4B, reducing the training time by half while achieving the same FID. Additionally, our approach can be applied to various LLM-based visual generation models and adheres to the scaling law, providing a promising direction for future research in LLM-based visual generation.",

Dominant video summarization approaches are generally based on recurrent or convolutional neural networks, even recent encoder-only transformers. We propose using full transformer as an alternative architecture to perform video summarization. The full transformer with an encoder-decoder structure, specifically designed for handling sequence transduction problems, is naturally suitable for video summarization tasks. This work considers supervised video summarization and casts it as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem. Our key idea is to directly apply the full transformer to the video summarization task, which is intuitively sound and effective. Also, considering the efficiency problem, we replace full attention with the combination of local and global sparse attention, which enables modeling long-range dependencies while reducing computational costs. Based on this, we propose a transformer-like architecture, named FullTransNet, which has a full encoder-decoder structure with local-global sparse attention for video summarization. Specifically, both the encoder and decoder in FullTransNet are stacked the same way as ones in the vanilla transformer, and the local-global sparse attention is used only at the encoder side. Extensive experiments on two public multimedia benchmark datasets SumMe and TVSum demonstrate that our proposed model can outperform other video summarization approaches, achieving F-Measures of 54.4% on SumMe and 63.9% on TVSum with relatively lower compute and memory requirements, verifying its effectiveness and efficiency.

Unfortunately, disagreement over fundamental theoretical issues has led to stalemate, with entrenched camps of LLM optimists and pessimists often committed to very different views of how these systems work. Overcoming stalemate requires agreement on fundamental questions, and the goal of this paper is to address one such question, namely: is LLM behavior driven partly by representation-based information processing of the sort implicated in biological cognition, or is it driven entirely by processes of memorization and stochastic table look-up? This is a question about what kind of algorithm LLMs implement, and the answer carries serious implications for higher level questions about whether these systems have beliefs, intentions, concepts, knowledge, and understanding. I argue that LLM behavior is partially driven by representation-based information processing, and then I describe and defend a series of practical techniques for investigating these representations and developing explanations on their basis. The resulting account provides a groundwork for future theorizing about language models and their successors.",

To address this, our study introduces the Spatio Temporal Attention-based methodology for Target Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (STATVTPred). This approach integrates Global Positioning System(GPS) localization technology to track target movement and dynamically predict the vehicle's future path using comprehensive spatio-temporal trajectory data. We map the vehicle trajectory onto a directed graph, after which spatial attributes are extracted via a Graph Attention Networks(GATs). The Transformer technology is employed to yield temporal features from the sequence. These elements are then amalgamated with local road network structure maps to filter and deliver a smooth trajectory sequence, resulting in precise vehicle trajectory http://prediction.This study validates our proposed STATVTPred method on T-Drive and Chengdu taxi-trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that STATVTPred achieves 6.38% and 10.55% higher Average Match Rate (AMR) than the Transformer model on the Beijing and Chengdu datasets, respectively. Compared to the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, STATVTPred boosts AMR by 37.45% and 36.06% on the same datasets.

Despite the initial success, existing works mostly focus on the authenticity of data at the individual level, but pay less attention to preserving the population-level properties on the entire dataset. Such population-level properties include value distributions for each dimension and distributions of certain functional dependencies (e.g., cross-correlation, CC) between different dimensions. For instance, when generating house energy consumption TS data, the value distributions of the outside temperature and the kitchen temperature should be preserved, as well as the distribution of CC between them. Preserving such TS population-level properties is critical in maintaining the statistical insights of the datasets, mitigating model bias, and augmenting downstream tasks like TS prediction. Yet, it is often overlooked by existing models. Hence, data generated by existing models often bear distribution shifts from the original data. We propose Population-aware Diffusion for Time Series (PaD-TS), a new TS generation model that better preserves the population-level properties. The key novelties of PaD-TS include 1) a new training method explicitly incorporating TS population-level property preservation, and 2) a new dual-channel encoder model architecture that better captures the TS data structure. Empirical results in major benchmark datasets show that PaD-TS can improve the average CC distribution shift score between real and synthetic data by 5.9x while maintaining a performance comparable to state-of-the-art models on individual-level authenticity.",

        "abstract": "Designing structured visuals such as presentation slides is essential for communicative needs, necessitating both content creation and visual planning skills. In this work, we tackle the challenge of automated slide generation, where models produce slide presentations from natural language (NL) instructions. We first introduce the SlidesBench benchmark, the first benchmark for slide generation with 7k training and 585 testing examples derived from 310 slide decks across 10 domains. SlidesBench supports evaluations that are (i)reference-based to measure similarity to a target slide, and (ii)reference-free to measure the design quality of generated slides alone. We benchmark end-to-end image generation and program generation methods with a variety of models, and find that programmatic methods produce higher-quality slides in user-interactable formats. Built on the success of program generation, we create AutoPresent, an 8B Llama-based model trained on 7k pairs of instructions paired with code for slide generation, and achieve results comparable to the closed-source model GPT-4o. We further explore iterative design refinement where the model is tasked to self-refine its own output, and we found that this process improves the slide's quality. We hope that our work will provide a basis for future work on generating structured visuals.",

However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and computationally efficient trajectory generation.",

For diffusion equations, it is well known that the smoothing properties of point-wise smoothers, such as Gauss--Seidel, rapidly deteriorate as the strength of anisotropy increases. On the other hand, global smoothers based on line smoothing are known to generally provide good smoothing for diffusion problems, independent of the anisotropy strength. A natural question is whether global methods are really necessary to achieve good smoothing in such problems, or whether it can be obtained with locally overlapping block smoothers using sufficiently large blocks and overlap. Through local Fourier analysis and careful numerical experimentation, we show that global methods are indeed necessary to achieve anisotropy-robust smoothing. Specifically, for any fixed block size bounded sufficiently far away from the global domain size, we find that the smoothing properties of overlapping multiplicative Schwarz rapidly deteriorate with increasing anisotropy, irrespective of the amount of overlap between blocks. Moreover, our results indicate that anisotropy-robust smoothing requires blocks of diameter ${\\cal O}(\\epsilon^{-1/2})$ for anisotropy ratio $\\epsilon \\in (0,1]$.",

Data scarcity is a major, well-known barrier in data-driven scientific computing, so physics-guided generative AI holds significant promise. In scientific computing, most tasks study the conversion of multiple data modalities to describe physical phenomena, for example, spatial and waveform in seismic imaging, time and frequency in signal processing, and temporal and spectral in climate modeling; as such, multi-modal pairwise data generation is highly required instead of single-modal data generation, which is usually used in natural images (e.g., faces, scenery). Moreover, in real-world applications, the unbalance of available data in terms of modalities commonly exists; for example, the spatial data (i.e., velocity maps) in seismic imaging can be easily simulated, but real-world seismic waveform is largely lacking. While the most recent efforts enable the powerful diffusion model to generate multi-modal data, how to leverage the unbalanced available data is still unclear. In this work, we use seismic imaging in subsurface geophysics as a vehicle to present ``UB-Diff'', a novel diffusion model for multi-modal paired scientific data generation. One major innovation is a one-in-two-out encoder-decoder network structure, which can ensure pairwise data is obtained from a co-latent representation. Then, the co-latent representation will be used by the diffusion process for pairwise data generation. Experimental results on the OpenFWI dataset show that UB-Diff significantly outperforms existing techniques in terms of Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) score and pairwise evaluation, indicating the generation of reliable and useful multi-modal pairwise data.",

Various approaches have been proposed to address this drawback. One such approach focuses on reducing the number of tokens fed into the self-attention, known as token merging (ToMe). In our method, which is called cached adaptive token merging(CA-ToMe), we calculate the similarity between tokens and then merge the r proportion of the most similar tokens. However, due to the repetitive patterns observed in adjacent steps and the variation in the frequency of similarities, we aim to enhance this approach by implementing an adaptive threshold for merging tokens and adding a caching mechanism that stores similar pairs across several adjacent steps. Empirical results demonstrate that our method operates as a training-free acceleration method, achieving a speedup factor of 1.24 in the denoising process while maintaining the same FID scores compared to existing approaches.",

Existing quantitative measures of stereotypes are based on statistical parity that does not align with the sociological definition of stereotypes and, therefore, incorrectly categorizes biases as stereotypes. Instead of oversimplifying stereotypes as biases, we propose a quantitative measure of stereotypes that aligns with its sociological definition. We then propose OASIS to measure the stereotypes in a generated dataset and understand their origins within the T2I model. OASIS includes two scores to measure stereotypes from a generated image dataset: (M1) Stereotype Score to measure the distributional violation of stereotypical attributes, and (M2) WALS to measure spectral variance in the images along a stereotypical attribute. OASIS also includes two methods to understand the origins of stereotypes in T2I models: (U1) StOP to discover attributes that the T2I model internally associates with a given concept, and (U2) SPI to quantify the emergence of stereotypical attributes in the latent space of the T2I model during image generation. Despite the considerable progress in image fidelity, using OASIS, we conclude that newer T2I models such as FLUX.1 and SDv3 contain strong stereotypical predispositions about concepts and still generate images with widespread stereotypical attributes. Additionally, the quantity of stereotypes worsens for nationalities with lower Internet footprints.",

This has motivated the use of different noise schedules, the two most common choices being referred to as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding (VE). Here we revisit these schedules within the framework of stochastic interpolants. Using the Gaussian Mixture (GM) and Curie-Weiss (CW) data distributions as test case models, we first investigate the effect of the variance of the initial noise distribution and show that VP recovers the low-level feature (the distribution of each mode) but misses the high-level feature (the asymmetry between modes), whereas VE performs oppositely. We also show that this dichotomy, which happens when denoising by a constant amount in each step, can be avoided by using noise schedules specific to VP and VE that allow for the recovery of both high- and low-level features. Finally we show that these schedules yield generative models for the GM and CW model whose probability flow ODE can be discretized using $\\Theta_d(1)$ steps in dimension $d$ instead of the $\\Theta_d(\\sqrt{d})$ steps required by constant denoising.",

However, the internal mechanisms by which LLMs comprehend input and make effective predictions remain poorly understood. In this paper, we explore the working mechanism of LLMs in information processing from the perspective of Information Bottleneck Theory. We propose a non-training construction strategy to define a task space and identify the following key findings: (1) LLMs compress input information into specific task spaces (e.g., sentiment space, topic space) to facilitate task understanding; (2) they then extract and utilize relevant information from the task space at critical moments to generate accurate predictions. Based on these insights, we introduce two novel approaches: an Information Compression-based Context Learning (IC-ICL) and a Task-Space-guided Fine-Tuning (TS-FT). IC-ICL enhances reasoning performance and inference efficiency by compressing retrieved example information into the task space. TS-FT employs a space-guided loss to fine-tune LLMs, encouraging the learning of more effective compression and selection mechanisms. Experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of task space construction. Additionally, IC-ICL not only improves performance but also accelerates inference speed by over 40\\%, while TS-FT achieves superior results with a minimal strategy adjustment.",

Specifically, we propose an efficient grouping strategy based on view similarity, and use robust pointmap priors to obtain high-quality point clouds and camera poses for 3D scene initialization. After obtaining a reliable scene structure, we propose a novel densification approach that adaptively splits Gaussian primitives based on the average shape of neighboring Gaussian ellipsoids, utilizing KNN scheme. In this way, the proposed method tackles the limitation on initialization and optimization, leading to an efficient and accurate 3DGS modeling.

Traditional time-series models, such as ARIMA and GARCH, and recurrent neural networks, like LSTMs, have been widely applied to this task but struggle to capture the regime shifts and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. In this work, we propose CryptoMamba, a novel Mamba-based State Space Model (SSM) architecture designed to effectively capture long-range dependencies in financial time-series data. Our experiments show that CryptoMamba not only provides more accurate predictions but also offers enhanced generalizability across different market conditions, surpassing the limitations of previous models. Coupled with trading algorithms for real-world scenarios, CryptoMamba demonstrates its practical utility by translating accurate forecasts into financial outcomes. Our findings signal a huge advantage for SSMs in stock and cryptocurrency price forecasting tasks.",

However, constrained by the low-rank bottleneck and quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, stereo transformers still fail to demonstrate sufficient nonlinear expressiveness within a reasonable inference time. The lack of focus on key homonymous points renders the representations of such methods vulnerable to challenging conditions, including reflections and weak textures. Furthermore, a slow computing speed is not conducive to the application. To overcome these difficulties, we present the \\textbf{H}adamard \\textbf{A}ttention \\textbf{R}ecurrent Stereo \\textbf{T}ransformer (HART) that incorporates the following components: 1) For faster inference, we present a Hadamard product paradigm for the attention mechanism, achieving linear computational complexity. 2) We designed a Dense Attention Kernel (DAK) to amplify the differences between relevant and irrelevant feature responses. This allows HART to focus on important details. DAK also converts zero elements to non-zero elements to mitigate the reduced expressiveness caused by the low-rank bottleneck. 3) To compensate for the spatial and channel interaction missing in the Hadamard product, we propose MKOI to capture both global and local information through the interleaving of large and small kernel convolutions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our HART. In reflective area, HART ranked \\textbf{1st} on the KITTI 2012 benchmark among all published methods at the time of submission.

To address these issues, we propose ValuesRAG, a novel and effective framework that applies Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with in-context learning to integrate cultural and demographic knowledge dynamically during text generation. Leveraging the World Values Survey (WVS) dataset, ValuesRAG first generates summaries of values for each individual. Subsequently, we curated several representative regional datasets to serve as test datasets and retrieve relevant summaries of values based on demographic features, followed by a reranking step to select the top-k relevant summaries. ValuesRAG consistently outperforms baseline methods, both in the main experiment and in the ablation study where only the values summary was provided, highlighting ValuesRAG's potential to foster culturally aligned AI systems and enhance the inclusivity of AI-driven applications.",

However, the standard self-attention mechanism suffers from quadratic time complexity and linearly increased cache size. Sliding window attention (SWA) solves this problem by restricting the attention range to a fixed-size local context window. Nevertheless, SWA employs a uniform window size for each head in each layer, making it inefficient in capturing context of varying scales. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Multi-Scale Window Attention (MSWA) which applies diverse window sizes across heads and layers in the Transformer. It not only allows for different window sizes among heads within the same layer but also progressively increases window size allocation from shallow to deep layers, thus enabling the model to capture contextual information with different lengths and distances. Experimental results on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks substantiate that MSWA outperforms traditional local attention in both effectiveness and efficiency.",

These events provide rich motion cues that can be exploited for various computer vision tasks, such as action recognition. However, most existing DVS-based action recognition methods lose temporal information during data transformation or suffer from noise and outliers caused by sensor imperfections or environmental factors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that preserves and exploits the spatiotemporal structure of event data for action recognition. Our framework consists of two main components: 1) a point-wise event masked autoencoder (MAE) that learns a compact and discriminative representation of event patches by reconstructing them from masked raw event camera points data; 2) an improved event points patch generation algorithm that leverages an event data inlier model and point-wise data augmentation techniques to enhance the quality and diversity of event points patches. To the best of our knowledge, our approach introduces the pre-train method into event camera raw points data for the first time, and we propose a novel event points patch embedding to utilize transformer-based models on event cameras.",

However, the transferability of adversarial videos to unseen models--a common and practical real world scenario--remains unexplored. In this paper, we pioneer an investigation into the transferability of adversarial video samples across V-MLLMs. We find that existing adversarial attack methods face significant limitations when applied in black-box settings for V-MLLMs, which we attribute to the following shortcomings: (1) lacking generalization in perturbing video features, (2) focusing only on sparse key-frames, and (3) failing to integrate multimodal information. To address these limitations and deepen the understanding of V-MLLM vulnerabilities in black-box scenarios, we introduce the Image-to-Video MLLM (I2V-MLLM) attack. In I2V-MLLM, we utilize an image-based multimodal model (IMM) as a surrogate model to craft adversarial video samples. Multimodal interactions and temporal information are integrated to disrupt video representations within the latent space, improving adversarial transferability. In addition, a perturbation propagation technique is introduced to handle different unknown frame sampling strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can generate adversarial examples that exhibit strong transferability across different V-MLLMs on multiple video-text multimodal tasks. Compared to white-box attacks on these models, our black-box attacks (using BLIP-2 as surrogate model) achieve competitive performance, with average attack success rates of 55.48% on MSVD-QA and 58.26% on MSRVTT-QA for VideoQA tasks, respectively.

As LLMs always confidently make mistakes, these unit tests are not reliable, thereby diminishing the quality of reward signals. Motivated by the observation that scaling the number of solutions improves LLM performance, we explore the impact of scaling unit tests to enhance reward signal quality. Our pioneer experiment reveals a positive correlation between the number of unit tests and reward signal quality, with greater benefits observed in more challenging problems.

As a result, language models will shape how people learn about, perceive and interact with global cultures making it important to consider whose knowledge systems and perspectives are represented in models. Recognizing this importance, increasingly work in Machine Learning and NLP has focused on evaluating gaps in global cultural representational distribution within outputs. However, more work is needed on developing benchmarks for cross-cultural impacts of language models that stem from a nuanced sociologically-aware conceptualization of cultural impact or harm. We join this line of work arguing for the need of metricizable evaluations of language technologies that interrogate and account for historical power inequities and differential impacts of representation on global cultures, particularly for cultures already under-represented in the digital corpora. We look at two concepts of erasure: omission: where cultures are not represented at all and simplification i.e. when cultural complexity is erased by presenting one-dimensional views of a rich culture. The former focuses on whether something is represented, and the latter on how it is represented. We focus our analysis on two task contexts with the potential to influence global cultural production. First, we probe representations that a language model produces about different places around the world when asked to describe these contexts. Second, we analyze the cultures represented in the travel recommendations produced by a set of language model applications. Our study shows ways in which the NLP community and application developers can begin to operationalize complex socio-cultural considerations into standard evaluations and benchmarks.",

Existing approaches to headline generation typically rely solely on the article content, overlooking crucial contextual features such as sentiment, category, and aspect. This limitation significantly hinders their effectiveness and overall performance. This study addresses this limitation by introducing a novel corpus, BeliN (Bengali Religious News) - comprising religious news articles from prominent Bangladeshi online newspapers, and MultiGen - a contextual multi-input feature fusion headline generation approach. Leveraging transformer-based pre-trained language models such as BanglaT5, mBART, mT5, and mT0, MultiGen integrates additional contextual features - including category, aspect, and sentiment - with the news content. This fusion enables the model to capture critical contextual information often overlooked by traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MultiGen over the baseline approach that uses only news content, achieving a BLEU score of 18.61 and ROUGE-L score of 24.19, compared to baseline approach scores of 16.08 and 23.08, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating contextual features in headline generation for low-resource languages.

Recent research suggests that simpler linear models might outperform or at least provide competitive performance compared to complex Transformer-based models for TSF tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel data-efficient architecture, GLinear, for multivariate TSF that exploits periodic patterns to provide better accuracy. It also provides better prediction accuracy by using a smaller amount of historical data compared to other state-of-the-art linear predictors. Four different datasets (ETTh1, Electricity, Traffic, and Weather) are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed predictor. A performance comparison with state-of-the-art linear architectures (such as NLinear, DLinear, and RLinear) and transformer-based time series predictor (Autoformer) shows that the GLinear, despite being parametrically efficient, significantly outperforms the existing architectures in most cases of multivariate TSF. We hope that the proposed GLinear opens new fronts of research and development of simpler and more sophisticated architectures for data and computationally efficient time-series analysis.

Building on recent advancements in 3D Gaussian splatting, current methods have seen significant improvements in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. However, two major limitations remain: (1) difficulty in handling irreversible dynamic changes, such as tissue shearing, which are common in surgical scenes; and (2) the lack of hierarchical modeling for surgical scene deformation, which reduces rendering speed. To address these challenges, we introduce EH-SurGS, an efficient and high-fidelity reconstruction algorithm for deformable surgical scenes. We propose a deformation modeling approach that incorporates the life cycle of 3D Gaussians, effectively capturing both regular and irreversible deformations, thus enhancing reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present an adaptive motion hierarchy strategy that distinguishes between static and deformable regions within the surgical scene. This strategy reduces the number of 3D Gaussians passing through the deformation field, thereby improving rendering speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and rendering speed. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed components. We will open-source our code upon acceptance of the paper.",

In this paper, we propose a self-supervised music representation learning model for music understanding. Distinguished from previous studies adopting random projection or existing neural codec, the proposed model, named MuQ, is trained to predict tokens generated by Mel Residual Vector Quantization (Mel-RVQ). Our Mel-RVQ utilizes residual linear projection structure for Mel spectrum quantization to enhance the stability and efficiency of target extraction and lead to better performance. Experiments in a large variety of downstream tasks demonstrate that MuQ outperforms previous self-supervised music representation models with only 0.9K hours of open-source pre-training data. Scaling up the data to over 160K hours and adopting iterative training consistently improve the model performance. To further validate the strength of our model, we present MuQ-MuLan, a joint music-text embedding model based on contrastive learning, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zero-shot music tagging task on the MagnaTagATune dataset.

Generative Replay (GR)-based CL systems utilize a generative model to produce synthetic versions of past data, which are then combined with new data to retrain the primary model. Traditional machine learning techniques in this domain often struggle with catastrophic forgetting, where a model's performance on old data degrades over time.\nIn this paper, we introduce a GR-based CL system that employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with feature matching loss to generate high-quality malware samples.

Previous methods directly model graph structures and achieve significant success. However, these methods encounter bottlenecks due to the inherent irregularity of graphs. An innovative solution is converting graphs into textual representations, thereby harnessing the powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to process and comprehend graphs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of methodologies for applying LLMs to graphs, termed LLM4graph. The core of LLM4graph lies in transforming graphs into texts for LLMs to understand and analyze. Thus, we propose a novel taxonomy of LLM4graph methods in the view of the transformation. Specifically, existing methods can be divided into two paradigms: Graph2text and Graph2token, which transform graphs into texts or tokens as the input of LLMs, respectively. We point out four challenges during the transformation to systematically present existing methods in a problem-oriented perspective. For practical concerns, we provide a guideline for researchers on selecting appropriate models and LLMs for different graphs and hardware constraints. We also identify five future research directions for LLM4graph.",

        "abstract": "The exceptional generative capability of text-to-image models has raised substantial safety concerns regarding the generation of Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content and potential copyright infringement. To address these concerns, previous methods safeguard the models by eliminating inappropriate concepts. Nonetheless, these models alter the parameters of the backbone network and exert considerable influences on the structural (low-frequency) components of the image, which undermines the model's ability to retain non-target concepts. In this work, we propose our Dual encoder Modulation network (DuMo), which achieves precise erasure of inappropriate target concepts with minimum impairment to non-target concepts. In contrast to previous methods, DuMo employs the Eraser with PRior Knowledge (EPR) module which modifies the skip connection features of the U-NET and primarily achieves concept erasure on details (high-frequency) components of the image. To minimize the damage to non-target concepts during erasure, the parameters of the backbone U-NET are frozen and the prior knowledge from the original skip connection features is introduced to the erasure process. Meanwhile, the phenomenon is observed that distinct erasing preferences for the image structure and details are demonstrated by the EPR at different timesteps and layers. Therefore, we adopt a novel Time-Layer MOdulation process (TLMO) that adjusts the erasure scale of EPR module's outputs across different layers and timesteps, automatically balancing the erasure effects and model's generative ability. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on Explicit Content Erasure, Cartoon Concept Removal and Artistic Style Erasure, clearly outperforming alternative methods.

This approach has been successfully used in the Earth Observation (EO) domain, where views have a heterogeneous nature and can be affected by missing data. Despite the negative effect that missing data has on model predictions, the ML literature has used it as an augmentation technique to improve model generalization, like masking the input data. Inspired by this, we introduce novel methods for EO applications tailored to MVL with missing views. Our methods integrate the combination of a set to simulate all combinations of missing views as different training samples. Instead of replacing missing data with a numerical value, we use dynamic merge functions, like average, and more complex ones like Transformer. This allows the MVL model to entirely ignore the missing views, enhancing its predictive robustness. We experiment on four EO datasets with temporal and static views, including state-of-the-art methods from the EO domain. The results indicate that our methods improve model robustness under conditions of moderate missingness, and improve the predictive performance when all views are present. The proposed methods offer a single adaptive solution to operate effectively with any combination of available views.",

A key advancement in this area is the deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) technique that designs a direct mapping of input signals to channel symbols parameterized by a neural network, which can be trained for arbitrary channel models and semantic quality metrics. This paper advances the DeepJSCC framework toward a semantics-aligned, high-fidelity transmission approach, called semantics-guided diffusion DeepJSCC (SGD-JSCC). Existing schemes that integrate diffusion models (DMs) with JSCC face challenges in transforming random generation into accurate reconstruction and adapting to varying channel conditions. SGD-JSCC incorporates two key innovations: (1) utilizing some inherent information that contributes to the semantics of an image, such as text description or edge map, to guide the diffusion denoising process; and (2) enabling seamless adaptability to varying channel conditions with the help of a semantics-guided DM for channel denoising. The DM is guided by diverse semantic information and integrates seamlessly with DeepJSCC. In a slow fading channel, SGD-JSCC dynamically adapts to the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly estimated from the channel output, thereby eliminating the need for additional pilot transmissions for channel estimation. In a fast fading channel, we introduce a training-free denoising strategy, allowing SGD-JSCC to effectively adjust to fluctuations in channel gains. Numerical results demonstrate that, guided by semantic information and leveraging the powerful DM, our method outperforms existing DeepJSCC schemes, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions.",

The proposed framework aims to optimize both data transmission efficiency and decision accuracy by formulating an optimization problem that incorporates the Weber-Fechner law, serving as a metric for balancing bandwidth utilization and quality of experience (QoE). Specifically, we employ the large language and vision assistant (LLAVA) model to extract critical semantic information from raw image data captured by embodied AI agents (i.e., vehicles), reducing transmission data size by approximately more than 90\\% while retaining essential content for vehicular communication and decision-making. In the dynamic vehicular environment, we employ a generalized advantage estimation-based proximal policy optimization (GAE-PPO) method to stabilize decision-making under uncertainty. Simulation results show that attention maps from LLAVA highlight the model's focus on relevant image regions, enhancing semantic representation accuracy. Additionally, our proposed transmission strategy improves QoE by up to 36\\% compared to DDPG and accelerates convergence by reducing required steps by up to 47\\% compared to pure PPO. Further analysis indicates that adapting semantic symbol length provides an effective trade-off between transmission quality and bandwidth, achieving up to a 61.4\\% improvement in QoE when scaling from 4 to 8 vehicles.",

Quantizing both weights and activations can address these issues, with fine-grained block-wise quantization emerging as a promising hardware-supported solution to mitigate outliers.

To address this, we propose BlockDialect, a block-wise fine-grained mixed format technique that assigns a per-block optimal number format from formatbook for better data representation.

Importantly, DialectFP4 ensures hardware efficiency by selecting representable values as scaled integers compatible with low-precision integer arithmetic. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage approach for online DialectFP4 activation quantization. BlockDialect achieves 11.40% (6.90%) accuracy gain on the LLaMA3-8B (LLaMA2-7B) model compared to MXFP4 format with a comparable bit usage per data, while being only 5.89% (3.31%) below full precision even when quantizing full-path matrix multiplication.

This paper aims to explore interactive deepfake analysis by performing instruction tuning on multi-modal large language models (MLLMs).

To address these issues, we introduce (1) a GPT-assisted data construction process resulting in an instruction-following dataset called DFA-Instruct, (2) a benchmark named DFA-Bench, designed to comprehensively evaluate the capabilities of MLLMs in deepfake detection, deepfake classification, and artifact description, and (3) construct an interactive deepfake analysis system called DFA-GPT, as a strong baseline for the community, with the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module.

        "abstract": "While transformers demonstrate outstanding performance across various audio tasks, their application to neural vocoders remains challenging. Neural vocoders require the generation of long audio signals at the sample level, which demands high temporal resolution. This results in significant computational costs for attention map generation and limits their ability to efficiently process both global and local information. Additionally, the sequential nature of sample generation in neural vocoders poses difficulties for real-time processing, making the direct adoption of transformers impractical. To address these challenges, we propose RingFormer, a neural vocoder that incorporates the ring attention mechanism into a lightweight transformer variant, the convolution-augmented transformer (Conformer). Ring attention effectively captures local details while integrating global information, making it well-suited for processing long sequences and enabling real-time audio generation. RingFormer is trained using adversarial training with two discriminators. The proposed model is applied to the decoder of the text-to-speech model VITS and compared with state-of-the-art vocoders such as HiFi-GAN, iSTFT-Net, and BigVGAN under identical conditions using various objective and subjective metrics. Experimental results show that RingFormer achieves comparable or superior performance to existing models, particularly excelling in real-time audio generation.

This aligns with the concept of the wisdom of crowds, where diverse agents contribute collectively to generating effective solutions, making it particularly suitable for educational settings. Senior design projects, also known as capstone or final year projects, are pivotal in engineering education as they integrate theoretical knowledge with practical application, fostering critical thinking, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving skills. In this paper, we explore the use of Multi-Agent LLMs in supporting these senior design projects undertaken by engineering students, which often involve multidisciplinary considerations and conflicting objectives, such as optimizing technical performance while addressing ethical, social, and environmental concerns. We propose a framework where distinct LLM agents represent different expert perspectives, such as problem formulation agents, system complexity agents, societal and ethical agents, or project managers, thus facilitating a holistic problem-solving approach. This implementation leverages standard multi-agent system (MAS) concepts such as coordination, cooperation, and negotiation, incorporating prompt engineering to develop diverse personas for each agent. These agents engage in rich, collaborative dialogues to simulate human engineering teams, guided by principles from swarm AI to efficiently balance individual contributions towards a unified solution. We adapt these techniques to create a collaboration structure for LLM agents, encouraging interdisciplinary reasoning and negotiation similar to real-world senior design projects.

Research has shown that cybersickness can significantly be reflected in head and eye tracking data, along with other physiological data (e.g., TMP, EDA, and BMP). Despite the application of deep learning techniques such as CNNs and LSTMs, these models often struggle to capture the complex interactions between multiple data modalities and lack the capacity for real-time inference, limiting their practical application. Addressing this gap, we propose a lightweight model that leverages a transformer-based encoder with sparse self-attention to process bio-signal features and a PP-TSN network for video feature extraction. These features are then integrated via a cross-modal fusion module, creating a video-aware bio-signal representation that supports cybersickness prediction based on both visual and bio-signal inputs. Our model, trained with a lightweight framework, was validated on a public dataset containing eye and head tracking data, physiological data, and VR video, and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in cybersickness prediction, achieving a high accuracy of 93.13\\% using only VR video inputs. These findings suggest that our approach not only enables effective, real-time cybersickness prediction but also addresses the longstanding issue of modality interaction in VR environments. This advancement provides a foundation for future research on multimodal data integration in VR, potentially leading to more personalized, comfortable and widely accessible VR experiences.",

These trainable codecs have many advantages over traditional techniques, such as their straightforward adaptation to perceptual distortion metrics and high performance in specific fields thanks to their learning ability. However, current state-of-the-art neural codecs do not fully exploit the benefits of vector quantization and the existence of the entropy gradient in decoding devices. In this paper, we propose to leverage these two properties (vector quantization and entropy gradient) to improve the performance of off-the-shelf codecs. Firstly, we demonstrate that using non-uniform scalar quantization cannot improve performance over uniform quantization. We thus suggest using predefined optimal uniform vector quantization to improve performance. Secondly, we show that the entropy gradient, available at the decoder, is correlated with the reconstruction error gradient, which is not available at the decoder. We therefore use the former as a proxy to enhance compression performance. Our experimental results show that these approaches save between 1 to 3% of the rate for the same quality across various pretrained methods. In addition, the entropy gradient based solution improves traditional codec performance significantly as well.",

Despite advancements in image FR, video FR remains relatively under-explored, primarily due to challenges related to temporal consistency, motion artifacts, and the limited availability of high-quality video data. Moreover, traditional face restoration typically prioritizes enhancing resolution and may not give as much consideration to related tasks such as facial colorization and inpainting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the Generalized Video Face Restoration (GVFR) task, which integrates video BFR, inpainting, and colorization tasks that we empirically show to benefit each other. We present a unified framework, termed as stable video face restoration (SVFR), which leverages the generative and motion priors of Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) and incorporates task-specific information through a unified face restoration framework. A learnable task embedding is introduced to enhance task identification. Meanwhile, a novel Unified Latent Regularization (ULR) is employed to encourage the shared feature representation learning among different subtasks. To further enhance the restoration quality and temporal stability, we introduce the facial prior learning and the self-referred refinement as auxiliary strategies used for both training and inference. The proposed framework effectively combines the complementary strengths of these tasks, enhancing temporal coherence and achieving superior restoration quality. This work advances the state-of-the-art in video FR and establishes a new paradigm for generalized video face restoration.",

In this paper, we first propose a hierarchical ability taxonomy that includes three levels of abilities. Then, based on this taxonomy, we collect images and annotations from publicly available datasets in the face and human community and build a semi-automatic data pipeline to produce problems for the new benchmark. Finally, the obtained Face-Human-Bench comprises a development set with 900 problems and a test set with 1800 problems, supporting both English and Chinese. We conduct evaluations over 25 mainstream multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) with our Face-Human-Bench, focusing on the correlation between abilities, the impact of the relative position of targets on performance, and the impact of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting on performance. Moreover, inspired by multi-modal agents, we also explore which abilities of MLLMs need to be supplemented by specialist models.",

While recent developments, driven by powerful large language models (LLMs), aim to be general enough to cover a wide range of categories, they often overlook the need for more specific capabilities. In this work, we address the more challenging task of Fine-grained Action Recognition (FAR), which focuses on detailed semantic labels within shorter temporal duration (e.g., \"salto backward tucked with 1 turn\"). Given the high costs of annotating fine-grained labels and the substantial data needed for fine-tuning LLMs, we propose to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our framework, SeFAR, incorporates several innovative designs to tackle these challenges. Specifically, to capture sufficient visual details, we construct Dual-level temporal elements as more effective representations, based on which we design a new strong augmentation strategy for the Teacher-Student learning paradigm through involving moderate temporal perturbation. Furthermore, to handle the high uncertainty within the teacher model's predictions for FAR, we propose the Adaptive Regulation to stabilize the learning process. Experiments show that SeFAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two FAR datasets, FineGym and FineDiving, across various data scopes. It also outperforms other semi-supervised methods on two classical coarse-grained datasets, UCF101 and HMDB51. Further analysis and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our designs. Additionally, we show that the features extracted by our SeFAR could largely promote the ability of multimodal foundation models to understand fine-grained and domain-specific semantics.",

The Subgraph Extractor first samples subgraphs from the KB. Then, the LLM uses these subgraphs to propose diverse and meaningful rules that are helpful for inferring missing facts. To effectively avoid hallucination in LLMs' generations, these proposed rules are further refined by a Rule Reasoner to pinpoint the most significant rules in the KB for Knowledge Base Completion. Our approach offers several key benefits: the utilization of LLMs to enhance the richness and diversity of the proposed rules and the integration with rule-based reasoning to improve reliability. Our method also demonstrates strong performance across diverse KB datasets, highlighting the robustness and generalizability of the proposed framework.",

Existing benchmarks, like LiveCodeBench and USACO, fall short due to the unavailability of private test cases, lack of support for special judges, and misaligned execution environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeElo, a standardized competition-level code generation benchmark that effectively addresses all these challenges for the first time. CodeElo benchmark is mainly based on the official CodeForces platform and tries to align with the platform as much as possible. We compile the recent six months of contest problems on CodeForces with detailed information such as contest divisions, problem difficulty ratings, and problem algorithm tags. We introduce a unique judging method in which problems are submitted directly to the platform and develop a reliable Elo rating calculation system that aligns with the platform and is comparable with human participants but has lower variance. By testing on our CodeElo, we provide the Elo ratings of 30 existing popular open-source and 3 proprietary LLMs for the first time. The results show that o1-mini and QwQ-32B-Preview stand out significantly, achieving Elo ratings of 1578 and 1261, respectively, while other models struggle even with the easiest problems, placing in the lowest 20 percent among all human participants.

However, the inherent nonlinear and ill-posed characteristics of HSI reconstruction still pose challenges to existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To address this issue, we propose a Mamba-inspired Joint Unfolding Network (MiJUN), which integrates physics-embedded DUNs with learning-based HSI imaging. Firstly, leveraging the concept of trapezoid discretization to expand the representation space of unfolding networks, we introduce an accelerated unfolding network scheme. This approach can be interpreted as a generalized accelerated half-quadratic splitting with a second-order differential equation, which reduces the reliance on initial optimization stages and addresses challenges related to long-range interactions. Crucially, within the Mamba framework, we restructure the Mamba-inspired global-to-local attention mechanism by incorporating a selective state space model and an attention mechanism. This effectively reinterprets Mamba as a variant of the Transformer} architecture, improving its adaptability and efficiency. Furthermore, we refine the scanning strategy with Mamba by integrating the tensor mode-$k$ unfolding into the Mamba network. This approach emphasizes the low-rank properties of tensors along various modes, while conveniently facilitating 12 scanning directions. Numerical and visual comparisons on both simulation and real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MiJUN, and achieving overwhelming detail representation.",

However, LLMs often fail to effectively self-verify and generate correct feedback, further misleading refinement and leading to the failure of self-correction, especially in complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Program-driven Self-Correction (ProgCo). First, program-driven verification (ProgVe) achieves complex verification logic and extensive validation through self-generated, self-executing verification pseudo-programs. Then, program-driven refinement (ProgRe) receives feedback from ProgVe, conducts dual reflection and refinement on both responses and verification programs to mitigate misleading of incorrect feedback in complex reasoning tasks. Experiments on three instruction-following and mathematical benchmarks indicate that ProgCo achieves effective self-correction, and can be further enhance performance when combined with real program tools.",

This study compares the latent community structures of LLM-generated text and human-written text within a hypothesis testing procedure. Specifically, we analyze three text sets: original human-written texts ($\\mathcal{O}$), their LLM-paraphrased versions ($\\mathcal{G}$), and a twice-paraphrased set ($\\mathcal{S}$) derived from $\\mathcal{G}$. Our analysis addresses two key questions: (1) Is the difference in latent community structures between $\\mathcal{O}$ and $\\mathcal{G}$ the same as that between $\\mathcal{G}$ and $\\mathcal{S}$? (2) Does $\\mathcal{G}$ become more similar to $\\mathcal{O}$ as the LLM parameter controlling text variability is adjusted? The first question is based on the assumption that if LLM-generated text truly resembles human language, then the gap between the pair ($\\mathcal{O}$, $\\mathcal{G}$) should be similar to that between the pair ($\\mathcal{G}$, $\\mathcal{S}$), as both pairs consist of an original text and its paraphrase. The second question examines whether the degree of similarity between LLM-generated and human text varies with changes in the breadth of text generation. To address these questions, we propose a statistical hypothesis testing framework that leverages the fact that each text has corresponding parts across all datasets due to their paraphrasing relationship. This relationship enables the mapping of one dataset's relative position to another, allowing two datasets to be mapped to a third dataset. As a result, both mapped datasets can be quantified with respect to the space characterized by the third dataset, facilitating a direct comparison between them. Our results indicate that GPT-generated text remains distinct from human-authored text.",

In this paper, we propose HaluSearch, a novel framework that incorporates tree search-based algorithms (e.g. MCTS) to enable an explicit slow thinking generation process for mitigating hallucinations of LLMs during inference. Specifically, HaluSearch frames text generation as a step-by-step reasoning process, using a self-evaluation reward model to score each generation step and guide the tree search towards the most reliable generation pathway for fully exploiting the internal knowledge of LLMs. To balance efficiency and quality, we introduce a hierarchical thinking system switch mechanism inspired by the dual process theory in cognitive science, which dynamically alternates between fast and slow thinking modes at both the instance and step levels, adapting to the complexity of questions and reasoning states. We conduct extensive experiments on both English and Chinese datasets and the results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline approaches.",

Moreover, these approaches use the same prompt for all LLMs, overlooking the fact that different LLMs might be best suited to different prompts. Given the wide variety of possible prompt formulations, automatically discovering the optimal prompt for each LLM presents a significant challenge. Although there are methods on automated prompt optimization in the natural language processing field, they are hard to produce effective prompts for the test case generation task. First, the methods iteratively optimize prompts by simply combining and mutating existing ones without proper guidance, resulting in prompts that lack diversity and tend to repeat the same errors in the generated test cases. Second, the prompts are generally lack of domain contextual knowledge, limiting LLMs' performance in the task.",

Using this framework, we demonstrate how techniques like chain-of-thought prompting and reinforcement learning with human feedback fundamentally alter the knowledge structures of internal (pre-trained) and external (context-dependent) knowledge in LLMs. CoT particularly enhances base model performance and shows synergistic benefits when applied to aligned LLMs. Moreover, our layer-wise analysis reveals that higher layers in LLMs encode more high-confidence knowledge, while low-confidence knowledge tends to emerge in middle-to-lower layers.",

To address this issue, we present and publicly release CySecBench, a comprehensive dataset containing 12662 prompts specifically designed to evaluate jailbreaking techniques in the cybersecurity domain. The dataset is organized into 10 distinct attack-type categories, featuring close-ended prompts to enable a more consistent and accurate assessment of jailbreaking attempts.

Our experimental results show that this method successfully elicits harmful content from commercial black-box LLMs, achieving Success Rates (SRs) of 65% with ChatGPT and 88% with Gemini; in contrast, Claude demonstrated greater resilience with a jailbreaking SR of 17%. Compared to existing benchmark approaches, our method shows superior performance, highlighting the value of domain-specific evaluation datasets for assessing LLM security measures.

However, they can be easily misled by unfaithful arguments during conversations, even when their original statements are correct. To this end, we investigate the problem of maintaining faithful integrity in LLMs. This involves ensuring that LLMs adhere to their faithful statements in the face of opposing arguments and are able to correct their incorrect statements when presented with faithful arguments. In this work, we propose a novel framework, named Alignment for Faithful Integrity with Confidence Estimation (AFICE), which aims to align the LLM responses with faithful integrity. Specifically, AFICE first designs a Bilateral Confidence Estimation (BCE) approach for estimating the uncertainty of each response generated by the LLM given a specific context, which simultaneously estimate the model's confidence to the question based on the internal states during decoding as well as to the answer based on cumulative probability ratios. With the BCE, we construct a conversational preference dataset composed of context, original statement, and argument, which is adopted for aligning the LLM for faithful integrity using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Extensive experimental results on a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in the LLM's ability to maintain faithful responses when encountering opposing arguments, ensuring both the practical utility and trustworthiness of LLMs in complex interactive settings.

The adapters are trained to dynamically encode nuanced features from rich self-supervised features, and the decoder fuses them to produce speech that accurately resembles the reference with minimal loss of content.

However, the majority of the prior art requires form-specific annotations to fine-tune the original model, leading to poor test-time generalizability. Meanwhile, existing training-free methods work well only with simplified prompts and spatial conditions. In this work, we propose a novel yet generic test-time controllable generation method that aims at natural text prompts and complex conditions. Specifically, we decouple spatial conditions into semantic and geometric conditions and then enforce their consistency during the image-generation process individually. As for the former, we target bridging the gap between the semantic condition and text prompts, as well as the gap between such condition and the attention map from diffusion models. To achieve this, we propose to first complete the prompt w.r.t. semantic condition, and then remove the negative impact of distracting prompt words by measuring their statistics in attention maps as well as distances in word space w.r.t. this condition. To further cope with the complex geometric conditions, we introduce a geometric transform module, in which Region-of-Interests will be identified in attention maps and further used to translate category-wise latents w.r.t. geometric condition. More importantly, we propose a diffusion-based latents-refill method to explicitly remove the impact of latents at the RoI, reducing the artifacts on generated images.

Current approaches often face challenges in maintaining a balance between identity preservation and alignment with the input text prompt. Some methods rely on a single textual token to represent a subject, which limits expressiveness, while others employ richer representations but disrupt the model's prior, diminishing prompt alignment. In this work, we introduce Nested Attention, a novel mechanism that injects a rich and expressive image representation into the model's existing cross-attention layers. Our key idea is to generate query-dependent subject values, derived from nested attention layers that learn to select relevant subject features for each region in the generated image. We integrate these nested layers into an encoder-based personalization method, and show that they enable high identity preservation while adhering to input text prompts. Our approach is general and can be trained on various domains. Additionally, its prior preservation allows us to combine multiple personalized subjects from different domains in a single image.",

Using structure-from-motion (SfM) as a benchmark for 3D tasks, we investigate if intermediate features from OpenSora, a video generation model, can support camera pose estimation. We first examine native 3D awareness in video generation features by routing raw intermediate outputs to SfM-prediction modules like DUSt3R. Then, we explore the impact of fine-tuning on camera pose estimation to enhance 3D awareness. Results indicate that while video generator features have limited inherent 3D awareness, task-specific supervision significantly boosts their accuracy for camera pose estimation, resulting in competitive performance. The proposed unified model, named JOG3R, produces camera pose estimates with competitive quality without degrading video generation quality.",

        "abstract": "Latent diffusion models with Transformer architectures excel at generating high-fidelity images. However, recent studies reveal an optimization dilemma in this two-stage design: while increasing the per-token feature dimension in visual tokenizers improves reconstruction quality, it requires substantially larger diffusion models and more training iterations to achieve comparable generation performance. Consequently, existing systems often settle for sub-optimal solutions, either producing visual artifacts due to information loss within tokenizers or failing to converge fully due to expensive computation costs. We argue that this dilemma stems from the inherent difficulty in learning unconstrained high-dimensional latent spaces. To address this, we propose aligning the latent space with pre-trained vision foundation models when training the visual tokenizers. Our proposed VA-VAE (Vision foundation model Aligned Variational AutoEncoder) significantly expands the reconstruction-generation frontier of latent diffusion models, enabling faster convergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) in high-dimensional latent spaces. To exploit the full potential of VA-VAE, we build an enhanced DiT baseline with improved training strategies and architecture designs, termed LightningDiT. The integrated system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on ImageNet 256x256 generation with an FID score of 1.35 while demonstrating remarkable training efficiency by reaching an FID score of 2.11 in just 64 epochs--representing an over 21 times convergence speedup compared to the original DiT.

Our approach addresses the task of generating semantically coherent compositions across diverse scenes and styles, similar to the versatility and expressiveness offered by text prompts. A key challenge in this task is to preserve the identity of the objects depicted in the input visual prompts, while also generating diverse compositions across different images. To address this challenge, we introduce a new KV-mixed cross-attention mechanism, in which keys and values are learned from distinct visual representations. The keys are derived from an encoder with a small bottleneck for layout control, whereas the values come from a larger bottleneck encoder that captures fine-grained appearance details. By mixing keys and values from these complementary sources, our model preserves the identity of the visual prompts while supporting flexible variations in object arrangement, pose, and composition. During inference, we further propose object-level compositional guidance to improve the method's identity preservation and layout correctness. Results show that our technique produces diverse scene compositions that preserve the unique characteristics of each visual prompt, expanding the creative potential of text-to-image generation.",

The proposed SynFMC dataset includes diverse objects and environments and covers various motion patterns according to specific rules, simulating common and complex real-world scenarios. The complete 6D pose information facilitates models learning to disentangle the motion effects from objects and the camera in a video. To validate the effectiveness and generalization of SynFMC, we further propose a method, Free-Form Motion Control (FMC).

Spatio-temporally aligning the features from each encoder allows us to tackle a wider range of open-ended and multiple-choice video understanding questions and outperform prior state-of-the-art works.

Starting from a text-to-video model, we utilize an ID extractor to inject the global identity and leverage a box sequence to control the overall motion. To preserve the detailed appearance and meanwhile support fine-grained motion control, we design a pixel warper. It takes the reference image with arbitrary key-points and the corresponding key-point trajectories as inputs. It warps the pixel details according to the trajectories and fuses the warped features with the diffusion U-Net, thus improving detail preservation and supporting users in manipulating the motion trajectories. In addition, we propose a training strategy involving both videos and static images with a reweight reconstruction loss to enhance insertion quality. VideoAnydoor demonstrates significant superiority over existing methods and naturally supports various downstream applications (e.g., talking head generation, video virtual try-on, multi-region editing) without task-specific fine-tuning.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in image-text understanding tasks. However, their performance in 3D spatial comprehension, which is critical for embodied intelligence, remains limited. Recent advances have leveraged 3D point clouds and multi-view images as inputs, yielding promising results. However, we propose exploring a purely vision-based solution inspired by human perception, which merely relies on visual cues for 3D spatial understanding. This paper empirically investigates the limitations of VLMs in 3D spatial knowledge, revealing that their primary shortcoming lies in the lack of global-local correspondence between the scene and individual frames. To address this, we introduce GPT4Scene, a novel visual prompting paradigm in VLM training and inference that helps build the global-local relationship, significantly improving the 3D spatial understanding of indoor scenes. Specifically, GPT4Scene constructs a 3D Bird's Eye View (BEV) image from the video and marks consistent object IDs across both frames and the BEV image. The model then inputs the concatenated BEV image and video frames with markers. In zero-shot evaluations, GPT4Scene improves performance over closed-source VLMs like GPT-4o. Additionally, we prepare a processed video dataset consisting of 165K text annotation to fine-tune open-source VLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all 3D understanding tasks. Surprisingly, after training with the GPT4Scene paradigm, VLMs consistently improve during inference, even without visual prompting and BEV image as explicit correspondence. It demonstrates that the proposed paradigm helps VLMs develop an intrinsic ability to understand 3D scenes, which paves the way for a noninvasive approach to extending pre-trained VLMs for 3D scene understanding.",

We then use RL with rewards based on syntactic and semantic accuracy measures generalizing the LLM further to recognize disordered speech. While the resulting LLM does not outperform existing systems for speech recognition, we find that tuning with reinforcement learning using custom rewards leads to substantially better performance than supervised fine-tuning of the language model, specifically when adapting to speech in a different setting. This presents a compelling alternative tuning strategy for speech recognition using large language models.",

However, the practical limits of classical simulatability for quantum circuits remain unclear, especially with current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the output of a quantum Turing machine using Grover's quantum circuits, known to provide quadratic speedups over classical counterparts. To this end, we developed GroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter architecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens. Unlike brute-force state-vector simulations, which demand substantial computational resources, GroverGPT employs pattern recognition to approximate quantum search algorithms without explicitly representing quantum states. Analyzing 97K quantum search instances, GroverGPT consistently outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o (45\\% accuracy), achieving nearly 100\\% accuracy on 6- and 10-qubit datasets when trained on 4-qubit or larger datasets. It also demonstrated strong generalization, surpassing 95\\% accuracy for systems with over 20 qubits when trained on 3- to 6-qubit data. Analysis indicates GroverGPT captures quantum features of Grover's search rather than classical patterns, supported by novel prompting strategies to enhance performance. Although accuracy declines with increasing system size, these findings offer insights into the practical boundaries of classical simulatability.

The heart of our method consists into approaching these scores via a computationally cheap estimator and relating the variance of this estimator to the smoothness properties of the forward process. Under the assumption that the density to sample from is $L$-log-smooth and that the forward process is semi-log-concave: $-\\nabla^2 \\log(p_t) \\succeq -\\beta I_d$ for some $\\beta \\geq 0$, we prove that our algorithm achieves an expected $\\epsilon$ error in $\\text{KL}$ divergence in $O(d^7L^{d+2}\\epsilon^{-2(d+3)} (L+\\beta)^2d^{2(d+1)})$ time. In particular, our result allows to fully transfer the problem of sampling from a log-smooth distribution into a regularity estimate problem. As an application, we derive an exponential complexity improvement for the problem of sampling from a $L$-log-smooth distribution that is $\\alpha$-strongly log-concave distribution outside some ball of radius $R$: after proving that such distributions verify the semi-log-concavity assumption, a result which might be of independent interest, we recover a $poly(R,L,\\alpha^{-1}, \\epsilon^{-1})$ complexity in fixed dimension which exponentially improves upon the previously known $poly(e^{RL^2}, L,\\alpha^{-1}, \\log(\\epsilon^{-1}))$ complexity in the low precision regime.",

While deep learning approaches have been applied to address these challenges, their black-box nature raises concerns about trust and explainability. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications due to their ability to understand multi-modal data and generate explainable decisions. However, single LLM faces limitations in complex, comprehensive tasks such as asset investment. These limitations are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency investment, where LLMs have less domain-specific knowledge in their training corpora.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose an explainable, multi-modal, multi-agent framework for cryptocurrency investment. Our framework uses specialized agents that collaborate within and across teams to handle subtasks such as data analysis, literature integration, and investment decision-making for the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The expert training module fine-tunes agents using multi-modal historical data and professional investment literature, while the multi-agent investment module employs real-time data to make informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. Unique intrateam and interteam collaboration mechanisms enhance prediction accuracy by adjusting final predictions based on confidence levels within agent teams and facilitating information sharing between teams.

        "abstract": "This work introduces Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx), an extension of Transformer-based Powered Descent Guidance (T-PDG), generalizable for efficient six-degree-of-freedom (DoF) fuel-optimal powered descent trajectory generation. Our approach significantly enhances the sample efficiency and solution quality for nonconvex-powered descent guidance by employing a rotation invariant transformation of the sampled dataset. T-PDG was previously applied to the 3-DoF minimum fuel powered descent guidance problem, improving solution times by up to an order of magnitude compared to lossless convexification (LCvx). By learning to predict the set of tight or active constraints at the optimal control problem's solution, Transformer-based Successive Convexification (T-SCvx) creates the minimal reduced-size problem initialized with only the tight constraints, then uses the solution of this reduced problem to warm-start the direct optimization solver. 6-DoF powered descent guidance is known to be challenging to solve quickly and reliably due to the nonlinear and non-convex nature of the problem, the discretization scheme heavily influencing solution validity, and reference trajectory initialization determining algorithm convergence or divergence. Our contributions in this work address these challenges by extending T-PDG to learn the set of tight constraints for the successive convexification (SCvx) formulation of the 6-DoF powered descent guidance problem. In addition to reducing the problem size, feasible and locally optimal reference trajectories are also learned to facilitate convergence from the initial guess. T-SCvx enables onboard computation of real-time guidance trajectories, demonstrated by a 6-DoF Mars powered landing application problem.",

        "abstract": "Grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion serves as an essential component in Chinese Mandarin text-to-speech (TTS) system, where polyphone disambiguation is the core issue. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework to predict the pronunciation of a polyphonic character, which accepts sentence containing polyphonic character as input in the form of Chinese character sequence without the necessity of any preprocessing. The proposed method consists of a pre-trained bidirectional encoder representations from Transformers (BERT) model and a neural network (NN) based classifier. The pre-trained BERT model extracts semantic features from a raw Chinese character sequence and the NN based classifier predicts the polyphonic character's pronunciation according to BERT output. In out experiments, we implemented three classifiers, a fully-connected network based classifier, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network based classifier and a Transformer block based classifier. The experimental results compared with the baseline approach based on LSTM demonstrate that, the pre-trained model extracts effective semantic features, which greatly enhances the performance of polyphone disambiguation. In addition, we also explored the impact of contextual information on polyphone disambiguation.",

        "abstract": "Transformers demonstrate significant advantages as the building block of modern LLMs. In this work, we study the capacities of Transformers in performing unsupervised learning. We show that multi-layered Transformers, given a sufficiently large set of pre-training instances, are able to learn the algorithms themselves and perform statistical estimation tasks given new instances. This learning paradigm is distinct from the in-context learning setup and is similar to the learning procedure of human brains where skills are learned through past experience. Theoretically, we prove that pre-trained Transformers can learn the spectral methods and use the classification of bi-class Gaussian mixture model as an example. Our proof is constructive using algorithmic design techniques. Our results are built upon the similarities of multi-layered Transformer architecture with the iterative recovery algorithms used in practice. Empirically, we verify the strong capacity of the multi-layered (pre-trained) Transformer on unsupervised learning through the lens of both the PCA and the Clustering tasks performed on the synthetic and real-world datasets.",
