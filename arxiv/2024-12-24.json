        "abstract": "The complexity of laboratory environments requires solutions that simplify instrument interaction and enhance measurement automation. Traditional tools often require configuration, software, and programming skills, creating barriers to productivity. Previous approaches, including dedicated software suites and custom scripts, frequently fall short in providing user-friendly solutions that align with programming practices. We present LABIIUM, an AI-enhanced, zero-configuration measurement automation system designed to streamline experimental workflows and improve user productivity. LABIIUM integrates an AI assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate code. LABIIUM's Lab-Automation-Measurement Bridges (LAMBs) enable seamless instrument connectivity using standard tools such as VSCode and Python, eliminating setup overhead. To demonstrate its capabilities, we conducted experiments involving the measurement of the parametric transfer curve of a simple two-transistor inverting amplifier with a current source load. The AI assistant was evaluated using different prompt scenarios and compared with multiple models, including Claude Sonnet 3.5, Gemini Pro 1.5, and GPT-4o. An expert solution implementing the Gradient-Weighted Adaptive Stochastic Sampling (GWASS) method was used as a baseline. The solutions generated by the AI assistant were compared with the expert solution and a uniform linear sweep baseline with 10,000 points. The graph results show that the LLMs were able to successfully complete the most basic uniform sweep, but LLMs were unable to develop adaptive sweeping algorithms to compete with GWASS. The evaluation underscores LABIIUM's ability to enhance laboratory productivity and support digital transformation in research and industry, and emphasizes the future work required to improve LLM performance in Electronic Measurement Science Tasks.",

Victims in distress often struggle to convey critical information due to panic, speech disorders, and background noise, further complicating dispatchers' ability to assess situations accurately. Staffing shortages in emergency centers exacerbate delays in coordination and assistance. This paper proposes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to address these challenges by reconstructing incomplete speech, filling contextual gaps, and prioritizing calls based on severity. The system integrates real-time transcription with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate contextual responses, using Twilio and AssemblyAI APIs for seamless implementation. Evaluation shows high precision, favorable BLEU and ROUGE scores, and alignment with real-world needs, demonstrating the model's potential to optimize emergency response workflows and prioritize critical cases effectively.",

Their subtle vocal signals encode health conditions, emotional states, and dynamic interactions within ecosystems. Understanding the semantics of these calls provides a valuable tool for interpreting their functional vocabulary and clarifying how each sound serves a specific purpose in social and environmental contexts. We apply advanced Natural Language Processing and transformer based models to translate bioacoustic data into meaningful insights. Our method integrates Wave2Vec 2.0 for raw audio feature extraction with a fine tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model, pretrained on a broad corpus of animal sounds and adapted to poultry tasks. This pipeline decodes poultry vocalizations into interpretable categories including distress calls, feeding signals, and mating vocalizations, revealing emotional nuances often overlooked by conventional analyses. Achieving 92 percent accuracy in classifying key vocalization types, our approach demonstrates the feasibility of real time automated monitoring of flock health and stress. By tracking this functional vocabulary, farmers can respond proactively to environmental or behavioral changes, improving poultry welfare, reducing stress related productivity losses, and supporting more sustainable farm management. Beyond agriculture, this research enhances our understanding of computational ecology. Accessing the semantic foundation of animal calls may indicate biodiversity, environmental stressors, and species interactions, informing integrative ecosystem level decision making.",

However, this cache consumes significant GPU memory. In this work, we introduce LSH-E, an algorithm that uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to compress the KV cache. LSH-E quickly locates tokens in the cache that are cosine dissimilar to the current query token. This is achieved by computing the Hamming distance between binarized Gaussian projections of the current token query and cached token keys, with a projection length much smaller than the embedding dimension. We maintain a lightweight binary structure in GPU memory to facilitate these calculations. Unlike existing compression strategies that compute attention to determine token retention, LSH-E makes these decisions pre-attention, thereby reducing computational costs. Additionally, LSH-E is dynamic - at every decoding step, the key and value of the current token replace the embeddings of a token expected to produce the lowest attention score. We demonstrate that LSH-E can compress the KV cache by 30%-70% while maintaining high performance across reasoning, multiple-choice, long-context retrieval and summarization tasks.",

After bimanual tool motions are captured, derived kinematic metrics are reliable predictors of performance in laparoscopic tasks. Implementing automated tool tracking requires time-intensive human annotation. We developed AI-based tool tracking using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to eliminate the need for human annotators. Here, we describe a study evaluating the usefulness of our tool tracking model in automated assessment during a laparoscopic suturing task in the fundoplication procedure. An automated tool tracking model was applied to recorded videos of Nissen fundoplication on porcine bowel. Surgeons were grouped as novices (PGY1-2) and experts (PGY3-5, attendings). The beginning and end of each suturing step were segmented, and motions of the left and right tools were extracted. A low-pass filter with a 24 Hz cut-off frequency removed noise. Performance was assessed using supervised and unsupervised models, and an ablation study compared results. Kinematic features--RMS velocity, RMS acceleration, RMS jerk, total path length, and Bimanual Dexterity--were extracted and analyzed using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and XGBoost. PCA was performed for feature reduction. For unsupervised learning, a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) model with classifiers, such as a 1-D CNN and traditional models, was trained. Data were extracted for 28 participants (9 novices, 19 experts). Supervised learning with PCA and Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 0.795 and an F1 score of 0.778. The unsupervised 1-D CNN achieved superior results with an accuracy of 0.817 and an F1 score of 0.806, eliminating the need for kinematic feature computation.

However, they still struggle to coherently present multiple sequential events in the stories specified by the prompts, which is foreseeable an essential capability for future long video generation scenarios. For example, top T2V generative models still fail to generate a video of the short simple story 'how to put an elephant into a refrigerator.' While existing detail-oriented benchmarks primarily focus on fine-grained metrics like aesthetic quality and spatial-temporal consistency, they fall short of evaluating models' abilities to handle event-level story presentation. To address this gap, we introduce StoryEval, a story-oriented benchmark specifically designed to assess text-to-video (T2V) models' story-completion capabilities. StoryEval features 423 prompts spanning 7 classes, each representing short stories composed of 2-4 consecutive events. We employ advanced vision-language models, such as GPT-4V and LLaVA-OV-Chat-72B, to verify the completion of each event in the generated videos, applying a unanimous voting method to enhance reliability. Our methods ensure high alignment with human evaluations, and the evaluation of 11 models reveals its challenge, with none exceeding an average story-completion rate of 50%. StoryEval provides a new benchmark for advancing T2V models and highlights the challenges and opportunities in developing next-generation solutions for coherent story-driven video generation.",

By embedding the MLO structure into the UNet in two forms, the model enhances the 3D consistency of dexterous hand-object manipulation. To further achieve the generalizable grasping of objects, we integrate Objaverse, a large-scale 3D object dataset, to address the scarcity of video data, thereby facilitating the learning of extensive object consistency. Additionally, we propose an innovative training strategy that effectively integrates multiple datasets, supporting downstream tasks such as human-centric hand-object manipulation video generation.

        "abstract": "Generating high-quality 3D digital assets often requires expert knowledge of complex design tools. We introduce Specialized Generative Primitives, a generative framework that allows non-expert users to author high-quality 3D scenes in a seamless, lightweight, and controllable manner. Each primitive is an efficient generative model that captures the distribution of a single exemplar from the real world. With our framework, users capture a video of an environment, which we turn into a high-quality and explicit appearance model thanks to 3D Gaussian Splatting. Users then select regions of interest guided by semantically-aware features. To create a generative primitive, we adapt Generative Cellular Automata to single-exemplar training and controllable generation. We decouple the generative task from the appearance model by operating on sparse voxels and we recover a high-quality output with a subsequent sparse patch consistency step. Each primitive can be trained within 10 minutes and used to author new scenes interactively in a fully compositional manner. We showcase interactive sessions where various primitives are extracted from real-world scenes and controlled to create 3D assets and scenes in a few minutes. We also demonstrate additional capabilities of our primitives: handling various 3D representations to control generation, transferring appearances, and editing geometries.",

Therefore, it is essential to verify the integrity of T2I diffusion models, especially when they are deployed as black-box services. To this end, considering the randomness within the outputs of generative models and the high costs in interacting with them, we capture modifications to the model through the differences in the distributions of the features of generated images. We propose a novel prompt selection algorithm based on learning automaton for efficient and accurate integrity verification of T2I diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, stability, accuracy and generalization of our algorithm against existing integrity violations compared with baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work addressing the integrity verification of T2I diffusion models, which paves the way to copyright discussions and protections for artificial intelligence applications in practice.",

While this approach has yielded impressive accuracy improvements, it has led to methods that may be impractical for real-world deployment due to computational overhead and latency constraints. This paper investigates the potential synergy between reasoning enhancement and computational efficiency by analyzing the integration of two contrasting approaches: Quiet-STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner) and REBASE (REward BAlanced SEarch). Through comprehensive empirical analysis using the Mistral-7B model on the GSM8K dataset, we demonstrate that while each method excels in its primary objective-Quiet-STaR achieving superior accuracy (32.03%) despite high computational cost (554.66s runtime, 12.73T FLOPs), and REBASE providing exceptional efficiency (8.47s runtime, 2.35T FLOPs) while maintaining baseline-comparable accuracy (10.94%)-their integration reveals fundamental challenges in reconciling reasoning depth with computational efficiency. The combined approach unexpectedly results in degraded performance (9.38% accuracy, 143.66s runtime), highlighting critical insights about the complex interplay between reasoning enhancement and efficiency optimization in LLMs. Our findings illuminate the need for novel architectures and algorithms specifically designed to bridge the gap between these competing objectives, while providing concrete directions for future research in compute-efficient reasoning methods.",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves documents to assist large language models (LLMs) in question answering; while Graph RAG (GRAG) uses structured knowledge bases as its knowledge source. However, many questions require both textual and relational information from SKB - referred to as \"hybrid\" questions - which complicates the retrieval process and underscores the need for a hybrid retrieval method that leverages both information. In this paper, through our empirical analysis, we identify key insights that show why existing methods may struggle with hybrid question answering (HQA) over SKB. Based on these insights, we propose HybGRAG for HQA consisting of a retriever bank and a critic module, with the following advantages: (1) Agentic, it automatically refines the output by incorporating feedback from the critic module, (2) Adaptive, it solves hybrid questions requiring both textual and relational information with the retriever bank, (3) Interpretable, it justifies decision making with intuitive refinement path, and (4) Effective, it surpasses all baselines on HQA benchmarks. In experiments on the STaRK benchmark, HybGRAG achieves significant performance gains, with an average relative improvement in Hit@1 of 51%.",

We present Self-Other Overlap (SOO) fine-tuning, a promising approach in AI Safety that could substantially improve our ability to build honest artificial intelligence. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience research on empathy, SOO aims to align how AI models represent themselves and others. Our experiments on LLMs with 7B, 27B, and 78B parameters demonstrate SOO's efficacy: deceptive responses of Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 dropped from 73.6% to 17.2% with no observed reduction in general task performance, while in Gemma-2-27b-it and CalmeRys-78B-Orpo-v0.1 deceptive responses were reduced from 100% to 9.3% and 2.7%, respectively, with a small impact on capabilities. In reinforcement learning scenarios, SOO-trained agents showed significantly reduced deceptive behavior. SOO's focus on contrastive self and other-referencing observations offers strong potential for generalization across AI architectures. While current applications focus on language models and simple RL environments, SOO could pave the way for more trustworthy AI in broader domains. Ethical implications and long-term effects warrant further investigation, but SOO represents a significant step forward in AI safety research.",

In stage 1, an auto-encoder is trained to compress an image into a latent space; in stage 2, a generative model is trained to learn a distribution over that latent space. Most work focuses on maximizing stage 1 performance independent of stage 2, assuming better reconstruction always leads to better generation. However, we show this is not strictly true. Smaller stage 2 models can benefit from more compressed stage 1 latents even if reconstruction performance worsens, showing a fundamental trade-off between compression and generation modeling capacity. To better optimize this trade-off, we introduce Causally Regularized Tokenization (CRT), which uses knowledge of the stage 2 generation modeling procedure to embed useful inductive biases in stage 1 latents. This regularization makes stage 1 reconstruction performance worse, but makes stage 2 generation performance better by making the tokens easier to model: we are able to improve compute efficiency 2-3$\\times$ over baseline and match state-of-the-art discrete autoregressive ImageNet generation (2.18 FID) with less than half the tokens per image (256 vs. 576) and a fourth the total model parameters (775M vs. 3.1B) as the previous SOTA (LlamaGen).",

Our trained policies exhibit zero-shot sim-to-real transfer with robust real-world performance using only on-board perception and computation. Our simulator, called FiGS, couples a computationally simple drone dynamics model with a high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting scene reconstruction. FiGS can quickly simulate drone flights producing photorealistic images at up to 130 fps. We use FiGS to collect 100k-300k observation-action pairs from an expert MPC with privileged state and dynamics information, randomized over dynamics parameters and spatial disturbances. We then distill this expert MPC into an end-to-end visuomotor policy with a lightweight neural architecture, called SV-Net. SV-Net processes color image, optical flow and IMU data streams into low-level body rate and thrust commands at 20Hz onboard a drone. Crucially, SV-Net includes a Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA) module that adapts at runtime to variations in drone dynamics. In a campaign of 105 hardware experiments, we show SOUS VIDE policies to be robust to 30% mass variations, 40 m/s wind gusts, 60% changes in ambient brightness, shifting or removing objects from the scene, and people moving aggressively through the drone's visual field.

In addition, the increasingly strict control over users' data by platform owners questions their trustworthiness as open interaction tools. These trends and, notably, the recent drastic change in X (formerly Twitter) policies and data accessibility through public APIs, have fuelled significant migration of users towards Fediverse platforms (primarily Mastodon). In this work, we provide an initial analysis of the microscopic properties of Mastodon users' social structures. Specifically, according to the Ego network model, we analyse interaction patterns between a large set of users (egos) and the other users they interact with (alters) to characterise the properties of those users' ego networks. As was observed previously in other OSNs, we found a quite regular structure compatible with the reference Dunbar's Ego Network model. Quite interestingly, our results show clear signs of ego network formation during the initial diffusion of a social networking tool, coherent with the recent surge of Mastodon activity. Therefore, our analysis motivates the use of Mastodon as an open \"big data microscope\" to characterise human social behaviour, making it a prime candidate to replace those OSN platforms that, unfortunately, cannot be used anymore for this purpose.",

        "abstract": "Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) is a powerful method for evaluating high-dimensional integrals. However, its use is typically limited to distributions where direct sampling is straightforward, such as the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube or the Gaussian distribution. For general target distributions with potentially unnormalized densities, leveraging the low-discrepancy property of QMC to improve accuracy remains challenging. We propose training a transport map to push forward the uniform distribution on the unit hypercube to approximate the target distribution. Inspired by normalizing flows, the transport map is constructed as a composition of simple, invertible transformations. To ensure that RQMC achieves its superior error rate, the transport map must satisfy specific regularity conditions. We introduce a flexible parametrization for the transport map that not only meets these conditions but is also expressive enough to model complex distributions. Our theoretical analysis establishes that the proposed transport QMC estimator achieves faster convergence rates than standard Monte Carlo, under mild and easily verifiable growth conditions on the integrand. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in Bayesian inference tasks.",

While most evaluations have focused on complex tasks such as scientific comprehension and visual reasoning, little attention has been given to assessing their fundamental image classification abilities. In this paper, we address this gap by thoroughly revisiting the MLLMs with an in-depth analysis of image classification. Specifically, building on established datasets, we examine a broad spectrum of scenarios, from general classification tasks (e.g., ImageNet, ObjectNet) to more fine-grained categories such as bird and food classification. Our findings reveal that the most recent MLLMs can match or even outperform CLIP-style vision-language models on several datasets, challenging the previous assumption that MLLMs are bad at image classification \\cite{VLMClassifier}. To understand the factors driving this improvement, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the network architecture, data selection, and training recipe used in public MLLMs. Our results attribute this success to advancements in language models and the diversity of training data sources. Based on these observations, we further analyze and attribute the potential reasons to conceptual knowledge transfer and enhanced exposure of target concepts, respectively. We hope our findings will offer valuable insights for future research on MLLMs and their evaluation in image classification tasks.",

However, two key challenges arise: (i) Limited controllability--users have minimal influence over the downstream task, as they can only modify input images, while the training of VLMs is often out of reach for most researchers. (ii) Lack of explainability--it is difficult to trace VLM errors to specific causes, such as failures in visual encoding or reasoning. We propose TextFlow, addressing aforementioned issues with two stages: (i) Vision Textualizer--which generates textual representations from flowchart images; and (ii) Textual Reasoner--which performs question-answering based on the text representations. TextFlow offers three key advantages: (i) users can select the type of text representations (e.g., Graphviz, Mermaid, PlantUML), or further convert them into executable graph object to call tools, enhancing performance and controllability; (ii) it improves explainability by helping to attribute errors more clearly to visual or textual processing components; and (iii) it promotes the modularization of the solution, such as allowing advanced LLMs to be used in the Reasoner stage when VLMs underperform in end-to-end fashion. Experiments on the FlowVQA and FlowLearn benchmarks demonstrate TextFlow's state-of-the-art performance as well as its robustness. All code is publicly available.",

This framing avoids committing our models to any particular definition of pedagogy, and instead allows teachers or developers to specify desired model behavior. It also clears a path to improving Gemini models for learning -- by enabling the addition of our pedagogical data to post-training mixtures -- alongside their rapidly expanding set of capabilities. Both represent important changes from our initial tech report. We show how training with pedagogical instruction following produces a LearnLM model (available on Google AI Studio) that is preferred substantially by expert raters across a diverse set of learning scenarios, with average preference strengths of 31\\% over GPT-4o, 11\\% over Claude 3.5, and 13\\% over the Gemini 1.5 Pro model LearnLM was based on.",

Human hands are unique and can leave distinct patterns, marks, or prints that can be utilized for forensic examinations. This paper compares various machine learning approaches to hand detection and presents the application results of employing the best-performing model to identify images of significant importance in forensic contexts. We fine-tune YOLOv8 and vision transformer-based object detection models on four hand image datasets, including the 11k hands dataset with our own bounding boxes annotated by a semi-automatic approach. Two YOLOv8 variants, i.e., YOLOv8 nano (YOLOv8n) and YOLOv8 extra-large (YOLOv8x), and two vision transformer variants, i.e., DEtection TRansformer (DETR) and Detection Transformers with Assignment (DETA), are employed for the experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the YOLOv8 models outperform DETR and DETA on all datasets. The experiments also show that YOLOv8 approaches result in superior performance compared with existing hand detection methods, which were based on YOLOv3 and YOLOv4 models. Applications of our fine-tuned YOLOv8 models for identifying hand images (or frames in a video) with high forensic values produce excellent results, significantly reducing the time required by forensic experts. This implies that our approaches can be implemented effectively for real-world applications in forensics or related fields.",

A key feature of LLMs is their ability to engage in multi-turn interactions with humans or external tools, enabling a wide range of tasks. Each new request in a multi-turn interaction depends on the intermediate state, specifically the key-value (K,V) caches, from previous requests in the ongoing interaction. Existing serving engines either recompute the K,V caches or offload them to main memory. Profiling reveals that recomputation can result in over 99% of processed tokens being redundant. On the other hand, offloading K,V caches from GPU memory makes inference serving stateful, leading to load imbalances across the cluster. To address these challenges, we developed SYMPHONY. SYMPHONY leverages the observation that multi-turn work loads provide additional hints that allow K,V caches to be migrated off the critical serving path. By utilizing these hints, SYMPHONY dynamically migrates K,V caches to enable finegrained scheduling of inference requests. Our experiments demonstrate that SYMPHONY can handle over 8x the number of requests compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with a similar latency profile.",

This paper addresses this pivotal question by developing a unified theoretical framework that integrates mathematical and statistical insights to explain the scaling dynamics of LLMs. We present: 1. Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for Hidden Representations: We show that noise in hidden representations scales inversely with context size, explaining stabilization effects and the limits of context length improvements. 2. Bias-Variance Decomposition: We decompose next-token prediction loss into irreducible entropy, capacity-driven bias, and finite sample variance, revealing trade-offs where scaling yields diminishing returns. 3. Emergent SNR Thresholds: By defining signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we quantify how capabilities emerge abruptly once SNR surpasses a threshold, offering insights into when scaling becomes less effective. Through this framework, we conclude that while LLMs have not reached an absolute scaling ceiling, practical constraints are increasingly prominent: diminishing returns, resource inefficiencies, and data limitations. Future progress will require a shift from brute-force scaling to innovations in architecture, data quality, and training paradigms. This work provides a roadmap for guiding the efficient development of next-generation LLMs and advancing the field beyond traditional scaling strategies.\nKeywords: Large Language Models; Scaling Ceiling; Central Limit Theorem; Bias-Variance Trade-Off; Signal-to-Noise Ratio; Emergent Capabilities",

To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, Large Language Model Behavior Correction with Influence Function Recall and Post-Training (LANCET), which requires no human involvement. LANCET consists of two phases: (1) using influence functions to identify the training data that significantly impact undesirable model outputs, and (2) applying an Influence function-driven Bregman Optimization (IBO) technique to adjust the model's behavior based on these influence distributions.

Recent research has shown that many students are aware of generative AI (GenAI) tools; however, there are gaps in the extent and effectiveness of how students use them. With over two years of widespread GenAI usage, it is crucial to understand whether students' help-seeking behaviors with these tools have evolved and how. This paper presents findings from a repeated cross-sectional survey conducted among computing students across North American universities (n=95). Our results indicate shifts in GenAI usage patterns. In 2023, 34.1% of students (n=47) reported never using ChatGPT for help, ranking it fourth after online searches, peer support, and class forums. By 2024, this figure dropped sharply to 6.3% (n=48), with ChatGPT nearly matching online search as the most commonly used help resource. Despite this growing prevalence, there has been a decline in students' hourly and daily usage of GenAI tools, which may be attributed to a common tendency to underestimate usage frequency. These findings offer new insights into the evolving role of GenAI in computing education, highlighting its increasing acceptance and solidifying its position as a key help resource.",

In view of this situation, it is particularly important to build an effective system for cutting off violent text. The study of violent text cutting off based on the BERT-fasttext model has significant meaning. BERT is a pre-trained language model with strong natural language understanding ability, which can deeply mine and analyze text semantic information; Fasttext itself is an efficient text classification tool with low complexity and good effect, which can quickly provide basic judgments for text processing. By combining the two and applying them to the system for cutting off violent text, on the one hand, it can accurately identify violent text, and on the other hand, it can efficiently and reasonably cut off the content, preventing harmful information from spreading freely on the network. Compared with the single BERT model and fasttext, the accuracy was improved by 0.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Through this model, it is helpful to purify the network environment, maintain the health of network information, and create a positive, civilized, and harmonious online communication space for netizens, driving the development of social networking, information dissemination, and other aspects in a more benign direction.",

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) have been applied to automatic speech recognition (ASR), the task of making the model streamable remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel model architecture, Transducer-Llama, that integrates LLMs into a Factorized Transducer (FT) model, naturally enabling streaming capabilities. Furthermore, given that the large vocabulary of LLMs can cause data sparsity issue and increased training costs for spoken language systems, this paper introduces an efficient vocabulary adaptation technique to align LLMs with speech system vocabularies. The results show that directly optimizing the FT model with a strong pre-trained LLM-based predictor using the RNN-T loss yields some but limited improvements over a smaller pre-trained LM predictor. Therefore, this paper proposes a weak-to-strong LM swap strategy, using a weak LM predictor during RNN-T loss training and then replacing it with a strong LLM. After LM replacement, the minimum word error rate (MWER) loss is employed to finetune the integration of the LLM predictor with the Transducer-Llama model. Experiments on the LibriSpeech and large-scale multi-lingual LibriSpeech corpora show that the proposed streaming Transducer-Llama approach gave a 17% relative WER reduction (WERR) over a strong FT baseline and a 32% WERR over an RNN-T baseline.",

However, existing alignment paradigms struggle to guide such advanced AI systems. Superalignment, the alignment of AI systems with human values and safety requirements at superhuman levels of capability aims to addresses two primary goals -- scalability in supervision to provide high-quality guidance signals and robust governance to ensure alignment with human values. In this survey, we examine scalable oversight methods and potential solutions for superalignment. Specifically, we explore the concept of ASI, the challenges it poses, and the limitations of current alignment paradigms in addressing the superalignment problem. Then we review scalable oversight methods for superalignment. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and propose pathways for the safe and continual improvement of ASI systems. By comprehensively reviewing the current literature, our goal is provide a systematical introduction of existing methods, analyze their strengths and limitations, and discuss potential future directions.",

To quantify this phenomenon, we define a new metric we term biased forgetting.

This is a key concern for Large Language Models (LLMs), as they are often fine-tuned on human preferences that may not accurately reflect a true objective. Existing work uses various tricks such as regularisation, tweaks to the reward model, and reward hacking detectors, to limit the influence that such proxy preferences have on a model. Luckily, in many contexts such as medicine, education, and law, a sparse amount of expert data is often available. In these cases, it is often unclear whether the addition of proxy data can improve policy learning. We outline a set of sufficient conditions on proxy feedback that, if satisfied, indicate that proxy data can provably improve the sample complexity of learning the ground truth policy. These conditions can inform the data collection process for specific tasks. The result implies a parameterisation for LLMs that achieves this improved sample complexity. We detail how one can adapt existing architectures to yield this improved sample complexity.",

Current methods use coordinates, positional encodings, or other geometry features as input to query neural implicit functions for signed distances and color which produce rendering errors to drive the optimization in overfitting image observations. However, due to the run time efficiency requirement in SLAM systems, we are merely allowed to conduct optimization on each frame in few iterations, which is far from enough for neural networks to overfit these queries. The underfitting usually results in severe drifts in camera tracking and artifacts in reconstruction. To resolve this issue, we propose query quantized neural SLAM which uses quantized queries to reduce variations of input for much easier and faster overfitting a frame. To this end, we quantize a query into a discrete representation with a set of codes, and only allow neural networks to observe a finite number of variations. This allows neural networks to become increasingly familiar with these codes after overfitting more and more previous frames. Moreover, we also introduce novel initialization, losses, and argumentation to stabilize the optimization with significant uncertainty in the early optimization stage, constrain the optimization space, and estimate camera poses more accurately. We justify the effectiveness of each design and report visual and numerical comparisons on widely used benchmarks to show our superiority over the latest methods in both reconstruction and camera tracking.",

Additionally, training with nighttime images presents another challenge: even human annotators struggle to accurately label objects in low-light conditions. This issue is particularly pronounced in transportation applications, such as detecting vehicles and other objects of interest on rural roads at night, where street lighting is often absent, and headlights may introduce undesirable glare. This study addresses these challenges by introducing a novel framework for labeling-free data augmentation, leveraging CARLA-generated synthetic data for day-to-night image style transfer. Specifically, the framework incorporates the Efficient Attention Generative Adversarial Network for realistic day-to-night style transfer and uses CARLA-generated synthetic nighttime images to help the model learn vehicle headlight effects. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we fine-tuned the YOLO11 model with an augmented dataset specifically curated for rural nighttime environments, achieving significant improvements in nighttime vehicle detection. This novel approach is simple yet effective, offering a scalable solution to enhance AI-based detection systems in low-visibility environments and extend the applicability of object detection models to broader real-world contexts.",

The common alignment with GPU tiling naturally fuses our PSH locality mechanism with FlashAttention at negligible extra cost. This mechanism affords flexible design choices throughout the backbone that result in superior downstream task results. Flash3D outperforms state-of-the-art PTv3 results on benchmark datasets, delivering a 2.25x speed increase and 2.4x memory efficiency boost. This efficiency enables scaling to wider attention scopes and larger models without additional overhead. Such scaling allows Flash3D to achieve even higher task accuracies than PTv3 under the same compute budget.",

However, there is an untrusted fusion problem. The reasons for this problem are as follows: 1) The current methods ignore the presence of noise or redundant information in the view; 2) The similarity of contrastive learning comes from the same sample rather than the same cluster in deep multi-view clustering. It causes multi-view fusion in the wrong direction. This paper proposes a novel multi-view clustering network to address this problem, termed as Trusted Mamba Contrastive Network (TMCN). Specifically, we present a new Trusted Mamba Fusion Network (TMFN), which achieves a trusted fusion of multi-view data through a selective mechanism. Moreover, we align the fused representation and the view-specific representation using the Average-similarity Contrastive Learning (AsCL) module. AsCL increases the similarity of view presentation from the same cluster, not merely from the same sample. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in deep multi-view clustering tasks.",

However, ViTs have a huge computational cost due to their inherent reliance on multi-head self-attention (MHSA), prompting efforts to accelerate ViTs for practical applications. To this end, recent works aim to reduce the number of tokens, mainly focusing on how to effectively prune or merge them. Nevertheless, since ViT tokens are generated from non-overlapping grid patches, they usually do not convey sufficient semantics, making it incompatible with efficient ViTs. To address this, we propose ImagePiece, a novel re-tokenization strategy for Vision Transformers. Following the MaxMatch strategy of NLP tokenization, ImagePiece groups semantically insufficient yet locally coherent tokens until they convey meaning. This simple retokenization is highly compatible with previous token reduction methods, being able to drastically narrow down relevant tokens, enhancing the inference speed of DeiT-S by 54% (nearly 1.5$\\times$ faster) while achieving a 0.39% improvement in ImageNet classification accuracy. For hyper-speed inference scenarios (with 251% acceleration), our approach surpasses other baselines by an accuracy over 8%.",

While many existing methods focus on discovering discriminative patterns in time series, real-world data does not always present such patterns, and sometimes raw numerical values can also serve as discriminative features. Additionally, the recent success of Transformer models has inspired many studies. However, when applying to time series classification, the self-attention mechanisms in Transformer models could introduce classification-irrelevant features, thereby compromising accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, VSFormer, that incorporates both discriminative patterns (shape) and numerical information (value). In addition, we extract class-specific prior information derived from supervised information to enrich the positional encoding and provide classification-oriented self-attention learning, thereby enhancing its effectiveness. Extensive experiments on all 30 UEA archived datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to SOTA models. Through ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the improved encoding layer and the proposed self-attention mechanism.

Traditionally, AI advancements have heavily relied on theoretical foundations from fields like mathematics and statistics.

This survey aims to establish a bridge between AI and mathematics, providing insights into the mutual benefits and fostering deeper interdisciplinary understanding.\nIn particular, we argue that while current AI and LLMs may struggle with complex deductive reasoning, their inherent creativity holds significant potential to support and inspire mathematical research. This creative capability, often overlooked, could be the key to unlocking new perspectives and methodologies in mathematics. Furthermore, we address the lack of cross-disciplinary communication: mathematicians may not fully comprehend the latest advances in AI, while AI researchers frequently prioritize benchmarks and standardized testing over AI's applications in frontier mathematical research. This paper seeks to close that gap, offering a detailed exploration of AI's basic knowledge, its strengths, and its emerging applications in the mathematical sciences.",

The most commonly used method of context modeling is full self-attention, as seen in standard decoder-only Transformers. Although powerful, this method can be inefficient for long sequences and may overlook inherent input structures. To address these problems, an alternative approach is parallel context encoding, which splits the context into sub-pieces and encodes them parallelly. Because parallel patterns are not encountered during training, naively applying parallel encoding leads to performance degradation. However, the underlying reasons and potential mitigations are unclear. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of this issue and identify that unusually high attention entropy can be a key factor. Furthermore, we adopt two straightforward methods to reduce attention entropy by incorporating attention sinks and selective mechanisms. Experiments on various tasks reveal that these methods effectively lower irregular attention entropy and narrow performance gaps.

ActPC-Chem is envisioned as a foundational \"cognitive kernel\" for advanced cognitive architectures, such as the OpenCog Hyperon system, incorporating essential elements of the PRIMUS cognitive architecture. The central thesis is that general-intelligence-capable cognitive structures and dynamics can emerge in a system where both data and models are represented as evolving patterns of metagraph rewrite rules, and where prediction errors, intrinsic and extrinsic rewards, and semantic constraints guide the continual reorganization and refinement of these rules. Using a virtual \"robot bug\" thought experiment, we illustrate how such a system might self-organize to handle challenging tasks involving delayed and context-dependent rewards, integrating causal rule inference (AIRIS) and probabilistic logical abstraction (PLN) to discover and exploit conceptual patterns and causal constraints. Next, we describe how continuous predictive coding neural networks, which excel at handling noisy sensory data and motor control signals, can be coherently merged with the discrete ActPC substrate. Finally, we outline how these ideas might be extended to create a transformer-like architecture that foregoes traditional backpropagation in favor of rule-based transformations guided by ActPC. This layered architecture, supplemented with AIRIS and PLN, promises structured, multi-modal, and logically consistent next-token predictions and narrative sequences.",

Due to their high training costs, many works leverage pre-trained diffusion models' powerful representations for downstream tasks, such as face super-resolution (FSR), through fine-tuning or prior-based methods. However, relying solely on priors without supervised training makes it challenging to meet the pixel-level accuracy requirements of discrimination task. Although prior-based methods can achieve high fidelity and high-quality results, ensuring consistency remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a masking strategy with strong and weak constraints and iterative refinement for real-world FSR, termed Diffusion Prior Interpolation (DPI). We introduce conditions and constraints on consistency by masking different sampling stages based on the structural characteristics of the face. Furthermore, we propose a condition Corrector (CRT) to establish a reciprocal posterior sampling process, enhancing FSR performance by mutual refinement of conditions and samples. DPI can balance consistency and diversity and can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained models. In extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real datasets, along with consistency validation in face recognition, DPI demonstrates superiority over SOTA FSR methods.

Motivated by this, we propose SPDFQ, a Semantics Prompting Data-Free Quantization method for ViTs. First, SPDFQ incorporates Attention Priors Alignment (APA), which uses randomly generated attention priors to enhance the semantics of synthetic images. Second, SPDFQ introduces Multi-Semantic Reinforcement (MSR), which utilizes localized patch optimization to prompt efficient parameterization and diverse semantics in synthetic images. Finally, SPDFQ employs Softlabel Learning (SL), where soft learning targets are adapted to encourage more complex semantics and accommodate images augmented by MSR.

Nevertheless, existing jailbreaking methods face numerous limitations, such as excessive query counts, limited coverage of jailbreak modalities, low attack success rates, and simplistic evaluation methods. To overcome these constraints, this paper proposes a multimodal jailbreaking method: JMLLM. This method integrates multiple strategies to perform comprehensive jailbreak attacks across text, visual, and auditory modalities. Additionally, we contribute a new and comprehensive dataset for multimodal jailbreaking research: TriJail, which includes jailbreak prompts for all three modalities.

This paper presents approaches to improve FIM code completion while addressing the challenge of maintaining low latency for real-time coding assistance. We enhance FIM code completion by incorporating context and curriculum examples in the training process. We identify patterns where completion suggestions fail more frequently, revealing complexities that smaller language models struggle with. To address these challenges, we develop a curriculum dataset by extracting hard-to-complete patterns from code repositories and generate context examples using semantic and static analysis tools (e.g. TSC compiler). We fine-tune various sized models, including StarCoder and DeepSeek, on this enhanced dataset. Our evaluation encompasses three key dimensions: the Santa Coder FIM task, the Amazon CCEval benchmark, and a new Multi-Line Infilling evaluation benchmark derived from SWE-bench. Comprehensive ablation studies across multiple model sizes reveal that while all fine-tuned models show improvements, the performance gains are more pronounced for smaller parameter models and incorporating difficult-to-complete examples, as part of curriculum learning, improves the code completion performance. This finding is particularly significant given the latency constraints of code completion tasks. While larger models like GPT and Claude perform well in multi-line completions but are prohibitively challenging to use given high latency, and our fine-tuned models achieve a balance between performance and latency. Finally, we validate our approach through online A/B testing, demonstrating tangible improvements in Completion Acceptance Rate (CAR) and Completion Persistence Rate (CPR), with zero latency impact.",

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limits the scalability of these systems and their deployment on resource-constrained devices. State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a solution by introducing a linear recurrence mechanism, which reduces the complexity of sequence modeling from quadratic to linear. Recently, SSMs have been extended to high-resolution vision tasks. Nonetheless, the linear recurrence mechanism struggles to fully utilize matrix multiplication units on modern hardware, resulting in a computational bottleneck. We address this issue by introducing \\textit{VMeanba}, a training-free compression method that eliminates the channel dimension in SSMs using mean operations. Our key observation is that the output activations of SSM blocks exhibit low variances across channels. Our \\textit{VMeanba} leverages this property to optimize computation by averaging activation maps across the channel to reduce the computational overhead without compromising accuracy. Evaluations on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that \\textit{VMeanba} achieves up to a 1.12x speedup with less than a 3\\% accuracy loss. When combined with 40\\% unstructured pruning, the accuracy drop remains under 3\\%.",

Although omnidirectional images are getting more popular since they reduce the computation for image stitching to composite a holistic scene, existing feed-forward models are only designed for perspective images. The unique optical properties of omnidirectional images make it difficult for feature encoders to correctly understand the context of the image and make the Gaussian non-uniform in space, which hinders the image quality synthesized from novel views. We propose OmniSplat, a pioneering work for fast feed-forward 3DGS generation from a few omnidirectional images. We introduce Yin-Yang grid and decompose images based on it to reduce the domain gap between omnidirectional and perspective images. The Yin-Yang grid can use the existing CNN structure as it is, but its quasi-uniform characteristic allows the decomposed image to be similar to a perspective image, so it can exploit the strong prior knowledge of the learned feed-forward network. OmniSplat demonstrates higher reconstruction accuracy than existing feed-forward networks trained on perspective images. Furthermore, we enhance the segmentation consistency between omnidirectional images by leveraging attention from the encoder of OmniSplat, providing fast and clean 3DGS editing results.",

To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features.

Our study involves three unit testing tasks, five benchmarks, eight evaluation metrics, and 37 popular LLMs across various architectures and sizes, consuming over 3,000 NVIDIA A100 GPU hours. We focus on three key research questions: (1) the performance of LLMs compared to state-of-the-art methods, (2) the impact of different factors on LLM performance, and (3) the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus prompt engineering. Our findings reveal that LLMs outperform existing state-of-the-art approaches on all three unit testing tasks across nearly all metrics, highlighting the potential of fine-tuning LLMs in unit testing tasks. Furthermore, large-scale, decoder-only models achieve the best results across tasks, while encoder-decoder models perform better under the same parameter scale. Additionally, the comparison of the performance between fine-tuning and prompt engineering approaches reveals the considerable potential capability of the prompt engineering approach in unit testing tasks.

        "abstract": "In recent speech enhancement (SE) research, transformer and its variants have emerged as the predominant methodologies. However, the quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism imposes certain limitations on practical deployment. Mamba, as a novel state-space model (SSM), has gained widespread application in natural language processing and computer vision due to its strong capabilities in modeling long sequences and relatively low computational complexity. In this work, we introduce Mamba-SEUNet, an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba with U-Net for SE tasks. By leveraging bidirectional Mamba to model forward and backward dependencies of speech signals at different resolutions, and incorporating skip connections to capture multi-scale information, our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Experimental results on the VCTK+DEMAND dataset indicate that Mamba-SEUNet attains a PESQ score of 3.59, while maintaining low computational complexity. When combined with the Perceptual Contrast Stretching technique, Mamba-SEUNet further improves the PESQ score to 3.73.",

In this paper, we demystified how traditional LLM jailbreak attacks behave in the Embodied AI context. We conducted a comprehensive safety analysis of the LLM-based planning module of embodied AI systems against jailbreak attacks. Using the carefully crafted Harmful-RLbench, we accessed 20 open-source and proprietary LLMs under traditional jailbreak attacks, and highlighted two key challenges when adopting the prior jailbreak techniques to embodied AI contexts: (1) The harmful text output by LLMs does not necessarily induce harmful policies in Embodied AI context, and (2) even we can generate harmful policies, we have to guarantee they are executable in practice. To overcome those challenges, we propose Policy Executable (POEX) jailbreak attacks, where harmful instructions and optimized suffixes are injected into LLM-based planning modules, leading embodied AI to perform harmful actions in both simulated and physical environments. Our approach involves constraining adversarial suffixes to evade detection and fine-tuning a policy evaluater to improve the executability of harmful policies. We conducted extensive experiments on both a robotic arm embodied AI platform and simulators, to validate the attack and policy success rates on 136 harmful instructions from Harmful-RLbench. Our findings expose serious safety vulnerabilities in LLM-based planning modules, including the ability of POEX to be transferred across models. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies, such as safety-constrained prompts, pre- and post-planning checks, to address these vulnerabilities and ensure the safe deployment of embodied AI in real-world settings.",

These web services allow fine-tuning a model between two parties: the client that provides the data, and the server that hosts the model. While convenient, these APIs raise a new concern: the data of the client is at risk of privacy breach during the training procedure. This challenge presents an important practical case of vertical federated learning, where the two parties perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of a large model. In this study, we systematically search for a way to fine-tune models over an API while keeping the labels private. We analyze the privacy of LoRA, a popular approach for parameter-efficient fine-tuning when training over an API. Using this analysis, we propose P$^3$EFT, a multi-party split learning algorithm that takes advantage of existing PEFT properties to maintain privacy at a lower performance overhead. To validate our algorithm, we fine-tune DeBERTa-v2-XXLarge, Flan-T5 Large and LLaMA-2 7B using LoRA adapters on a range of NLP tasks. We find that P$^3$EFT is competitive with existing privacy-preserving methods in multi-party and two-party setups while having higher accuracy.",

To address these challenges, we propose a novel, unified approach that models multi-person motions and their interactions within a single latent space. Our approach streamlines the process by treating interactive motions as an integrated data point, utilizing a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for compression into a unified latent space, and performing a diffusion process within this space, guided by the natural language conditions. Experimental results demonstrate our method's superiority over existing approaches in generation quality, performing text condition in particular when motions have significant asymmetry, and accelerating the generation efficiency while preserving high quality.",

To address this issue, we introduce NILE (iNternal consIstency aLignmEnt) framework, aimed at optimizing IFT datasets to unlock LLMs' capability further. NILE operates by eliciting target pre-trained LLM's internal knowledge corresponding to instruction data. The internal knowledge is leveraged to revise the answer in IFT datasets.

Our experiments demonstrate that NILE-aligned IFT datasets sharply boost LLM performance across multiple LLM ability evaluation datasets, achieving up to 66.6% gain on Arena-Hard and 68.5% on Alpaca-Eval V2. Further analysis confirms that each component of the NILE}framework contributes to these substantial performance improvements, and provides compelling evidence that dataset consistency with pre-trained internal knowledge is pivotal for maximizing LLM potential.",

However, current practices often overlook these considerations, resulting in inadequate and unevenly distributed elderly services in cities. There is a pressing need for equitable and optimized urban renewal strategies to support effective age-friendly planning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework, Fairness-driven Age-friendly community Planning via Conditional Diffusion generation (FAP-CD). FAP-CD leverages a conditioned graph denoising diffusion probabilistic model to learn the joint probability distribution of aging facilities and their spatial relationships at a fine-grained regional level. Our framework generates optimized facility distributions by iteratively refining noisy graphs, conditioned on the needs of the elderly during the diffusion process. Key innovations include a demand-fairness pre-training module that integrates community demand features and facility characteristics using an attention mechanism and min-max optimization, ensuring equitable service distribution across regions. Additionally, a discrete graph structure captures walkable accessibility within regional road networks, guiding model sampling. To enhance information integration, we design a graph denoising network with an attribute augmentation module and a hybrid graph message aggregation module, combining local and global node and edge information. Empirical results across multiple metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of FAP-CD in balancing age-friendly needs with regional equity, achieving an average improvement of 41% over competitive baseline models.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in the image and video generation tasks. Nevertheless, they often require a large amount of memory and time overhead during inference, due to the complex network architecture and considerable number of timesteps for iterative diffusion. Recently, the post-training quantization (PTQ) technique has proved a promising way to reduce the inference cost by quantizing the float-point operations to low-bit ones. However, most of them fail to tackle with the large variations in the distribution of activations across distinct channels and timesteps, as well as the inconsistent of input between quantization and inference on diffusion models, thus leaving much room for improvement. To address the above issues, we propose a novel method dubbed Timestep-Channel Adaptive Quantization for Diffusion Models (TCAQ-DM). Specifically, we develop a timestep-channel joint reparameterization (TCR) module to balance the activation range along both the timesteps and channels, facilitating the successive reconstruction procedure. Subsequently, we employ a dynamically adaptive quantization (DAQ) module that mitigate the quantization error by selecting an optimal quantizer for each post-Softmax layers according to their specific types of distributions. Moreover, we present a progressively aligned reconstruction (PAR) strategy to mitigate the bias caused by the input mismatch. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and distinct diffusion models demonstrate that the proposed method substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in most cases, especially yielding comparable FID metrics to the full precision model on CIFAR-10 in the W6A6 setting, while enabling generating available images in the W4A4 settings.",

Existing 3D generative models cannot yet match the fidelity of image or video generative models. State-of-the-art 3D generators are either trained with explicit 3D supervision and are thus limited by the volume and diversity of existing 3D data. Meanwhile, generators that can be trained with only 2D data as supervision typically produce coarser results, cannot be text-conditioned, or must revert to test-time optimization. We observe that GAN- and diffusion-based generators have complementary qualities: GANs can be trained efficiently with 2D supervision to produce high-quality 3D objects but are hard to condition on text. In contrast, denoising diffusion models can be conditioned efficiently but tend to be hard to train with only 2D supervision. We introduce GANFusion, which starts by generating unconditional triplane features for 3D data using a GAN architecture trained with only single-view 2D data. We then generate random samples from the GAN, caption them, and train a text-conditioned diffusion model that directly learns to sample from the space of good triplane features that can be decoded into 3D objects.",

        "abstract": "Current LLM structured pruning methods involve two steps: (1) compressing with calibration data and (2) continued pretraining on billions of tokens to recover the lost performance. This costly second step is needed as the first step significantly impacts performance. Previous studies have found that pretrained Transformer weights aren't inherently low-rank, unlike their activations, which may explain this performance drop. Based on this observation, we introduce a one-shot compression method that locally distills low-rank weights. We accelerate convergence by initializing the low-rank weights with SVD and using a joint loss that combines teacher and student activations. We reduce memory requirements by applying local gradient updates only. Our approach can compress Mixtral-8x7B within minutes on a single A100 GPU, removing 10 billion parameters while maintaining over 95% of the original performance. Phi-2 3B can be compressed by 40% using only 13 million calibration tokens into a small model that competes with recent models of similar size. We show our method generalizes well to non-transformer architectures: Mamba-3B can be compressed by 20% while maintaining 99% of its performance.",

However, the combination of LLM with argumentation computation remains an underexplored domain, despite its considerable potential for real-world applications requiring defeasible reasoning. In this paper, we aim to investigate the capability of LLMs in determining the extensions of various abstract argumentation semantics. To achieve this, we develop and curate a benchmark comprising diverse abstract argumentation frameworks, accompanied by detailed explanations of algorithms for computing extensions. Subsequently, we fine-tune LLMs on the proposed benchmark, focusing on two fundamental extension-solving tasks. As a comparative baseline, LLMs are evaluated using a chain-of-thought approach, where they struggle to accurately compute semantics. In the experiments, we demonstrate that the process explanation plays a crucial role in semantics computation learning. Models trained with explanations show superior generalization accuracy compared to those trained solely with question-answer pairs. Furthermore, by leveraging the self-explanation capabilities of LLMs, our approach provides detailed illustrations that mitigate the lack of transparency typically associated with neural networks. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of LLMs' potential in argumentation computation, offering promising avenues for further research in this domain.",

We first prove that KKAN is a universal approximator, and then we demonstrate its versatility across scientific machine-learning applications, including function regression, physics-informed machine learning (PIML), and operator-learning frameworks. The benchmark results show that KKANs outperform MLPs and the original Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in function approximation and operator learning tasks and achieve performance comparable to fully optimized MLPs for PIML. To better understand the behavior of the new representation models, we analyze their geometric complexity and learning dynamics using information bottleneck theory, identifying three universal learning stages, fitting, transition, and diffusion, across all types of architectures. We find a strong correlation between geometric complexity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with optimal generalization achieved during the diffusion stage.

Beyond reasoning and generation performance, political bias is an essential issue that warrants attention. Political bias, as a universal phenomenon in human society, may be transferred to LLMs and distort LLMs' behaviors of information acquisition and dissemination with humans, leading to unequal access among different groups of people. To prevent LLMs from reproducing and reinforcing political biases, and to encourage fairer LLM-human interactions, comprehensively examining political bias in popular LLMs becomes urgent and crucial.\nIn this study, we systematically measure the political biases in a wide range of LLMs, using a curated set of questions addressing political bias in various contexts. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in how LLMs respond to political topics. For highly polarized topics, most LLMs exhibit a pronounced left-leaning bias. Conversely, less polarized topics elicit greater consensus, with similar response patterns across different LLMs. Additionally, we analyze how LLM characteristics, including release date, model scale, and region of origin affect political bias. The results indicate political biases evolve with model scale and release date, and are also influenced by regional factors of LLMs.",

We demonstrate that these limitations can be sidestepped by reframing the generative process as a discrete optimal control episode. We derive a diffusion-based optimal controller inspired by the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) algorithm. This framework is fully general and able to handle any differentiable forward measurement operator, including super-resolution, inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, nonlinear deblurring, and even highly nonlinear neural classifiers. Furthermore, we show that the idealized posterior sampling equation can be recovered as a special case of our algorithm.

To address these challenges, we propose SilVar, a novel end-to-end multimodal model that uses speech instructions for reasoning in visual question answering. In addition, we investigate reasoning techniques with levels including conversational, simple, and complex speech instruction. SilVar is built upon CLIP, Whisper, and LLaMA 3.1-8B, enabling intuitive interactions by allowing users to provide verbal or text instructions. To this end, we introduce a dataset designed to challenge models with speech-based reasoning tasks for object localization. This dataset enhances the model ability to process and explain visual scenes from spoken input, moving beyond object recognition to reasoning-based interactions. The experiments show that SilVar achieves SOTA performance on the MMMU and ScienceQA benchmarks despite the challenge of speech-based instructions. We believe SilVar will inspire next-generation multimodal reasoning models, toward expert artificial general intelligence. Our code and dataset are available here.",

In order to make use of it, researchers have been asking whether similar phenomena arise in other domains. The answer has been yes, e.g. in behavioural sciences. However, one has to move to frameworks that take some degree of signalling into account. Two such frameworks exist: (1) a signalling-corrected sheaf theoretic model, and (2) the Contextuality-by-Default (CbD) framework. This paper provides the first large scale experimental evidence for a yes answer in natural language. We construct a linguistic schema modelled over a contextual quantum scenario, instantiate it in the Simple English Wikipedia and extract probability distributions for the instances using the large language model BERT. This led to the discovery of 77,118 sheaf-contextual and 36,938,948 CbD contextual instances. We proved that the contextual instances came from semantically similar words, by deriving an equation between degrees of contextuality and Euclidean distances of BERT's embedding vectors. A regression model further reveals that Euclidean distance is indeed the best statistical predictor of contextuality. Our linguistic schema is a variant of the co-reference resolution challenge. These results are an indication that quantum methods may be advantageous in language tasks.",

High-quality reconstrution of 3DGS relies on sufficient splats and a reasonable distribution of these splats to fit real geometric surface and texture details, which turns out to be a challenging problem. We present GeoTexDensifier, a novel geometry-texture-aware densification strategy to reconstruct high-quality Gaussian splats which better comply with the geometric structure and texture richness of the scene. Specifically, our GeoTexDensifier framework carries out an auxiliary texture-aware densification method to produce a denser distribution of splats in fully textured areas, while keeping sparsity in low-texture regions to maintain the quality of Gaussian point cloud. Meanwhile, a geometry-aware splitting strategy takes depth and normal priors to guide the splitting sampling and filter out the noisy splats whose initial positions are far from the actual geometric surfaces they aim to fit, under a Validation of Depth Ratio Change checking. With the help of relative monocular depth prior, such geometry-aware validation can effectively reduce the influence of scattered Gaussians to the final rendering quality, especially in regions with weak textures or without sufficient training views. The texture-aware densification and geometry-aware splitting strategies are fully combined to obtain a set of high-quality Gaussian splats. We experiment our GeoTexDensifier framework on various datasets and compare our Novel View Synthesis results to other state-of-the-art 3DGS approaches, with detailed quantitative and qualitative evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing more photorealistic 3DGS models.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) image generation quality but suffer from high latency and memory inefficiency, making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. One key efficiency bottleneck is that existing DiTs apply equal computation across all regions of an image. However, not all image tokens are equally important, and certain localized areas require more computation, such as objects. To address this, we propose DiffRatio-MoD, a dynamic DiT inference framework with differentiable compression ratios, which automatically learns to dynamically route computation across layers and timesteps for each image token, resulting in Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) efficient DiT models. Specifically, DiffRatio-MoD integrates three features: (1) A token-level routing scheme where each DiT layer includes a router that is jointly fine-tuned with model weights to predict token importance scores. In this way, unimportant tokens bypass the entire layer's computation; (2) A layer-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where different DiT layers automatically learn varying compression ratios from a zero initialization, resulting in large compression ratios in redundant layers while others remain less compressed or even uncompressed; (3) A timestep-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where each denoising timestep learns its own compression ratio. The resulting pattern shows higher ratios for noisier timesteps and lower ratios as the image becomes clearer. Extensive experiments on both text-to-image and inpainting tasks show that DiffRatio-MoD effectively captures dynamism across token, layer, and timestep axes, achieving superior trade-offs between generation quality and efficiency compared to prior works.",

Although existing multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks, they often struggle with generating high-quality design critiques -- a complex task that requires producing detailed design comments that are visually grounded in a given design's image. Building on recent advancements in iterative refinement of text output and visual prompting methods, we propose an iterative visual prompting approach for UI critique that takes an input UI screenshot and design guidelines and generates a list of design comments, along with corresponding bounding boxes that map each comment to a specific region in the screenshot. The entire process is driven completely by LLMs, which iteratively refine both the text output and bounding boxes using few-shot samples tailored for each step. We evaluated our approach using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, and found that human experts generally preferred the design critiques generated by our pipeline over those by the baseline, with the pipeline reducing the gap from human performance by 50% for one rating metric. To assess the generalizability of our approach to other multimodal tasks, we applied our pipeline to open-vocabulary object and attribute detection, and experiments showed that our method also outperformed the baseline.",

However, it is difficult for existing identity customization methods to simultaneously meet the various requirements of different real-world applications, including the identity fidelity of small face, the control of face location, pose and expression, as well as the customization of multiple persons. To this end, we propose a scale-robust and fine-controllable method, namely RealisID, which learns different control capabilities through the cooperation between a pair of local and global branches. Specifically, by using cropping and up-sampling operations to filter out face-irrelevant information, the local branch concentrates the fine control of facial details and the scale-robust identity fidelity within the face region. Meanwhile, the global branch manages the overall harmony of the entire image. It also controls the face location by taking the location guidance as input. As a result, RealisID can benefit from the complementarity of these two branches. Finally, by implementing our branches with two different variants of ControlNet, our method can be easily extended to handle multi-person customization, even only trained on single-person datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies indicate the effectiveness of RealisID and verify its ability in fulfilling all the requirements mentioned above.",

        "abstract": "Semantic segmentation requires labour-intensive labelling tasks to obtain the supervision signals, and because of this issue, it is encouraged that using domain adaptation, which transfers information from the existing labelled source domains to unlabelled or weakly labelled target domains, is essential. However, it is intractable to find a well-generalised representation which can describe two domains due to probabilistic or geometric difference between the two domains. This paper presents a novel method, the Conditional and Inter-coder Connected Latent Diffusion (CICLD) based Semantic Segmentation Model, to advance unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation tasks. Leveraging the strengths of latent diffusion models and adversarial learning, our method effectively bridges the gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. CICLD incorporates a conditioning mechanism to improve contextual understanding during segmentation and an inter-coder connection to preserve fine-grained details and spatial hierarchies. Additionally, adversarial learning aligns latent feature distributions across source, mixed, and target domains, further enhancing generalisation. Extensive experiments are conducted across three benchmark datasets-GTA5, Synthia, and Cityscape-shows that CICLD outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods. Notably, the proposed method achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 74.4 for the GTA5 to Cityscape UDA setting and 67.2 mIoU for the Synthia to Cityscape UDA setting.

However, current MLLM often struggles to effectively address fine-grained multi-modal challenges. We argue that this limitation is closely linked to the models' visual grounding capabilities. The restricted spatial awareness and perceptual acuity of visual encoders frequently lead to interference from irrelevant background information in images, causing the models to overlook subtle but crucial details. As a result, achieving fine-grained regional visual comprehension becomes difficult. In this paper, we break down multi-modal understanding into two stages, from Coarse to Fine (CoF). In the first stage, we prompt the MLLM to locate the approximate area of the answer. In the second stage, we further enhance the model's focus on relevant areas within the image through visual prompt engineering, adjusting attention weights of pertinent regions. This, in turn, improves both visual grounding and overall performance in downstream tasks. Our experiments show that this approach significantly boosts the performance of baseline models, demonstrating notable generalization and effectiveness.

However, in this optimization process, unsupervised learning objectives like entropy minimization frequently encounter noisy learning signals. These signals produce unreliable gradients, which hinder the model ability to converge to an optimal solution quickly and introduce significant instability into the optimization process. In this paper, we seek to resolve these issues from the perspective of optimizer design. Unlike prior TTA using manually designed optimizers like SGD, we employ a learning-to-optimize approach to automatically learn an optimizer, called Meta Gradient Generator (MGG). Specifically, we aim for MGG to effectively utilize historical gradient information during the online optimization process to optimize the current model. To this end, in MGG, we design a lightweight and efficient sequence modeling layer -- gradient memory layer. It exploits a self-supervised reconstruction loss to compress historical gradient information into network parameters, thereby enabling better memorization ability over a long-term adaptation process. We only need a small number of unlabeled samples to pre-train MGG, and then the trained MGG can be deployed to process unseen samples. Promising results on ImageNet-C, R, Sketch, and A indicate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art methods with fewer updates, less data, and significantly shorter adaptation iterations. Compared with a previous SOTA method SAR, we achieve 7.4% accuracy improvement and 4.2 times faster adaptation speed on ImageNet-C.",

However, their slow inference speed limits practical applications. Despite the development of various distillation techniques for diffusion models, we found that naive diffusion distillation methods do not yield satisfactory results. Distilled models exhibit reduced robustness with open-set input images and a decreased correlation between audio and video compared to teacher models, undermining the advantages of diffusion models. To address this, we propose FADA (Fast Diffusion Avatar Synthesis with Mixed-Supervised Multi-CFG Distillation). We first designed a mixed-supervised loss to leverage data of varying quality and enhance the overall model capability as well as robustness. Additionally, we propose a multi-CFG distillation with learnable tokens to utilize the correlation between audio and reference image conditions, reducing the threefold inference runs caused by multi-CFG with acceptable quality degradation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show that FADA generates vivid videos comparable to recent diffusion model-based methods while achieving an NFE speedup of 4.17-12.5 times.

This study proposes a novel approach to enhance supply chain transparency in emerging economies by leveraging online content and large language models (LLMs). We develop a Supply Chain Knowledge Graph Mining System that integrates advanced LLMs with web crawler technology to automatically collect and analyze supply chain information. The system's effectiveness is validated through a case study focusing on the semiconductor supply chain, a domain that has recently gained significant attention due to supply chain risks. Our results demonstrate that the proposed system provides greater applicability for emerging economies, such as mainland China, complementing the data gaps in existing datasets. However, challenges including the accurate estimation of monetary and material flows, the handling of time series data, synonyms disambiguation, and mitigating biases from online contents still remains.

Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks.

In this paper, we consider the new task of generalizable 3D semantic field modeling from sparse, uncalibrated image pairs. Building upon the Splatt3R architecture, we introduce GSemSplat, a framework that learns open-vocabulary semantic representations linked to 3D Gaussians without the need for per-scene optimization, dense image collections or calibration. To ensure effective and reliable learning of semantic features in 3D space, we employ a dual-feature approach that leverages both region-specific and context-aware semantic features as supervision in the 2D space. This allows us to capitalize on their complementary strengths. Experimental results on the ScanNet++ dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to the traditional scene-specific method.

In this work, we propose a Transformer-based Linguistics-Vision Monotonic Consistent Network (LVMCN) for SLP, which constrains fine-grained cross-modal monotonic alignment and coarse-grained multimodal semantic consistency in language-visual cues through Cross-modal Semantic Aligner (CSA) and Multimodal Semantic Comparator (MSC). In the CSA, we constrain the implicit alignment between corresponding gloss and pose sequences by computing the cosine similarity association matrix between cross-modal feature sequences (i.e., the order consistency of fine-grained sign glosses and actions). As for MSC, we construct multimodal triplets based on paired and unpaired samples in batch data. By pulling closer the corresponding text-visual pairs and pushing apart the non-corresponding text-visual pairs, we constrain the semantic co-occurrence degree between corresponding gloss and pose sequences (i.e., the semantic consistency of coarse-grained textual sentences and sign videos).

We identify the scarcity of deliberate multi-step reasoning data as a primary limiting factor. To this end, we introduce Enriched Instruction Tuning (EIT), a method that enriches existing human-annotated mathematical datasets by synergizing human and AI feedback to create fine-grained reasoning trajectories. These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs, enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any symbolic verification program. Concretely, EIT is composed of two critical steps: Enriching with Reasoning Plan (ERP) and Enriching with Reasoning Step (ERS). The former generates a high-level plan that breaks down complex instructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in reasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother reasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning. Unlike existing CoT prompting methods that generate reasoning chains only depending on LLM's internal knowledge, our method leverages human-annotated initial answers as ``meta-knowledge'' to help LLMs generate more detailed and precise reasoning processes, leading to a more trustworthy LLM expert for complex mathematical problems. In experiments, EIT achieves an accuracy of 84.1\\% on GSM8K and 32.5\\% on MATH, surpassing state-of-the-art fine-tuning and prompting methods, and even matching the performance of tool-augmented methods.",

However, the use of text prompts in virtual try-on is still underexplored. This paper tackles a text-editable virtual try-on task that changes the clothing item based on the provided clothing image while editing the wearing style (e.g., tucking style, fit) according to the text descriptions. In the text-editable virtual try-on, three key aspects exist: (i) designing rich text descriptions for paired person-clothing data to train the model, (ii) addressing the conflicts where textual information of the existing person's clothing interferes the generation of the new clothing, and (iii) adaptively adjust the inpainting mask aligned with the text descriptions, ensuring proper editing areas while preserving the original person's appearance irrelevant to the new clothing. To address these aspects, we propose PromptDresser, a text-editable virtual try-on model that leverages large multimodal model (LMM) assistance to enable high-quality and versatile manipulation based on generative text prompts. Our approach utilizes LMMs via in-context learning to generate detailed text descriptions for person and clothing images independently, including pose details and editing attributes using minimal human cost. Moreover, to ensure the editing areas, we adjust the inpainting mask depending on the text prompts adaptively. We found that our approach, utilizing detailed text prompts, not only enhances text editability but also effectively conveys clothing details that are difficult to capture through images alone, thereby enhancing image quality.

However, in terms of human motion generative models, existing works are still unable to generate high-quality interactive motions, especially in the field of duet dance. On the one hand, it is due to the lack of large-scale high-quality datasets. On the other hand, it arises from the incomplete representation of interactive motion and the lack of fine-grained optimization of interactions. To address these challenges, we propose, InterDance, a large-scale duet dance dataset that significantly enhances motion quality, data scale, and the variety of dance genres. Built upon this dataset, we propose a new motion representation that can accurately and comprehensively describe interactive motion. We further introduce a diffusion-based framework with an interaction refinement guidance strategy to optimize the realism of interactions progressively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and algorithm.",

        "abstract": "Auto-bidding is essential in facilitating online advertising by automatically placing bids on behalf of advertisers. Generative auto-bidding, which generates bids based on an adjustable condition using models like transformers and diffusers, has recently emerged as a new trend due to its potential to learn optimal strategies directly from data and adjust flexibly to preferences. However, generative models suffer from low-quality data leading to a mismatch between condition, return to go, and true action value, especially in long sequential decision-making. Besides, the majority preference in the dataset may hinder models' generalization ability on minority advertisers' preferences. While it is possible to collect high-quality data and retrain multiple models for different preferences, the high cost makes it unaffordable, hindering the advancement of auto-bidding into the era of large foundation models. To address this, we propose a flexible and practical Generative Auto-bidding scheme using post-training Search, termed GAS, to refine a base policy model's output and adapt to various preferences. We use weak-to-strong search alignment by training small critics for different preferences and an MCTS-inspired search to refine the model's output. Specifically, a novel voting mechanism with transformer-based critics trained with policy indications could enhance search alignment performance. Additionally, utilizing the search, we provide a fine-tuning method for high-frequency preference scenarios considering computational efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world dataset and online A/B test on the Kuaishou advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of GAS, achieving significant improvements, e.g., 1.554% increment of target cost.",

Yet, there is still insufficient understanding of how jailbreaking works, which makes it hard to develop effective defense strategies. We aim to shed more light into this issue: we conduct a detailed large-scale analysis of seven different jailbreak methods and find that these disagreements stem from insufficient observation samples. In particular, we introduce \\textit{safety boundary}, and we find that jailbreaks shift harmful activations outside that safety boundary, where LLMs are less sensitive to harmful information. We also find that the low and the middle layers are critical in such shifts, while deeper layers have less impact. Leveraging on these insights, we propose a novel defense called \\textbf{Activation Boundary Defense} (ABD), which adaptively constrains the activations within the safety boundary. We further use Bayesian optimization to selectively apply the defense method to the low and the middle layers. Our experiments on several benchmarks show that ABD achieves an average DSR of over 98\\% against various forms of jailbreak attacks, with less than 2\\% impact on the model's general capabilities.",

Traditional human-led methods often face challenges related to cost, scalability, and consistency. Recently, various domains have begun to explore the use of conversational agents (chatbots) powered by large language models (LLMs). However, as public investments and policies on infrastructure and services often involve substantial public stakes and environmental risks, there is a need for a rigorous, transparent, privacy-preserving, and cost-efficient development framework tailored for such major decision-making processes. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a modular approach and its resultant parameterized process for designing conversational agents. We detail the system architecture, integrating engineered prompts, specialized knowledge bases, and customizable, goal-oriented conversational logic in the proposed approach. We demonstrate the adaptability, generalizability, and efficacy of our modular approach through three empirical studies: (1) travel preference surveys, highlighting multimodal (voice, text, and image generation) capabilities; (2) public opinion elicitation on a newly constructed, novel infrastructure project, showcasing question customization and multilingual (English and French) capabilities; and (3) transportation expert consultation about future transportation systems, highlighting real-time, clarification request capabilities for open-ended questions, resilience in handling erratic inputs, and efficient transcript post-processing. The results show the effectiveness of this modular approach and how it addresses key ethical, privacy, security, and token consumption concerns, setting the stage for the next-generation surveys and interviews.",

In this paper, we investigate three potential information leakage during a federated fine-tuning procedure for LLM (FedLLM). Based on the potential information leakage, we provide an end-to-end privacy guarantee solution for FedLLM by inserting two-stage randomness. The first stage is to train a gradient auto-encoder with a Gaussian random prior based on the statistical information of the gradients generated by local clients. The second stage is to fine-tune the overall LLM with a differential privacy guarantee by adopting appropriate Gaussian noises. We show the efficiency and accuracy gains of our proposed method with several foundation models and two popular evaluation benchmarks.

Our focus is on hallucinations involving information not used in training, which we determine by using recency to ensure the information emerged after a cut-off date. This study investigates these hallucinations by detecting them at sentence level using different internal states of various LLMs. We present HalluRAG, a dataset designed to train classifiers on these hallucinations. Depending on the model and quantization, MLPs trained on HalluRAG detect hallucinations with test accuracies ranging up to 75 %, with Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 achieving the highest test accuracies. Our results show that IAVs detect hallucinations as effectively as CEVs and reveal that answerable and unanswerable prompts are encoded differently as separate classifiers for these categories improved accuracy.

Nonetheless, training-free methods for DIE encounter two primary challenges: (1) understanding the complex relationship between layout and textual elements in VRDs, and (2) providing accurate guidance to pre-trained models. To address these challenges, we propose Sample-centric In-context Learning (SAIL) for DIE. SAIL introduces a fine-grained entity-level textual similarity to facilitate in-depth text analysis by LLMs and incorporates layout similarity to enhance the analysis of layouts in VRDs. Additionally, SAIL formulates a unified In-Context Learning (ICL) prompt template for various sample-centric examples, enabling tailored prompts that deliver precise guidance to pre-trained models for each sample. Extensive experiments on FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE benchmarks with various base models (e.g., LLMs) indicate that our method outperforms training-free baselines, even closer to the full-training methods.

However, in computer vision, while text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved generation quality through scaling up, their framework design did not initially consider how to unify with downstream tasks, such as various types of editing. To address this, we introduce DreamOmni, a unified model for image generation and editing. We begin by analyzing existing frameworks and the requirements of downstream tasks, proposing a unified framework that integrates both T2I models and various editing tasks. Furthermore, another key challenge is the efficient creation of high-quality editing data, particularly for instruction-based and drag-based editing. To this end, we develop a synthetic data pipeline using sticker-like elements to synthesize accurate, high-quality datasets efficiently, which enables editing data scaling up for unified model training. For training, DreamOmni jointly trains T2I generation and downstream tasks. T2I training enhances the model's understanding of specific concepts and improves generation quality, while editing training helps the model grasp the nuances of the editing task. This collaboration significantly boosts editing performance. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of DreamOmni. The code and model will be released.",

This paper shows that the similarity of denoised images between consecutive time steps during the sampling process is related to the severity of artifacts in images generated by diffusion models. Building on this observation, we introduce the concept of Similarity Trajectory to characterize the sampling process and its correlation with the image artifacts presented. Using an annotated data set of 680 images, which is only 0.1% of the amount of data used in the prior work, we trained a classifier on these trajectories to predict the presence of artifacts in images. By performing 10-fold validation testing on the balanced annotated data set, the classifier can achieve an accuracy of 72.35%, highlighting the connection between the Similarity Trajectory and the occurrence of artifacts. This approach enables differentiation between artifact-exhibiting and natural-looking images using limited training data.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach to improve the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control by using a transformer to initialize the mean control sequence. Traditional MPPI methods often struggle with sample efficiency and computational costs due to suboptimal initial rollouts. We propose TransformerMPPI, which uses a transformer trained on historical control data to generate informed initial mean control sequences. TransformerMPPI combines the strengths of the attention mechanism in transformers and sampling-based control, leading to improved computational performance and sample efficiency. The ability of the transformer to capture long-horizon patterns in optimal control sequences allows TransformerMPPI to start from a more informed control sequence, reducing the number of samples required, and accelerating convergence to optimal control sequence. We evaluate our method on various control tasks, including avoidance of collisions in a 2D environment and autonomous racing in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles. Numerical simulations demonstrate that TransformerMPPI consistently outperforms traditional MPPI algorithms in terms of overall average cost, sample efficiency, and computational speed in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles.",

Guidelines for choosing an appropriate architecture would reduce analysis time for practitioners and motivate researchers to take the recommended models as foundations to be improved. We provide the first such guideline by extensively evaluating many normalizing flow architectures on various flow-based MCMC methods and target distributions. When the target density gradient is available, we show that flow-based MCMC outperforms classic MCMC for suitable NF architecture choices with minor hyperparameter tuning. When the gradient is unavailable, flow-based MCMC wins with off-the-shelf architectures. We find contractive residual flows to be the best general-purpose models with relatively low sensitivity to hyperparameter choice. We also provide various insights into normalizing flow behavior within MCMC when varying their hyperparameters, properties of target distributions, and the overall computational budget.",

FoamPilot provides three core functionalities: code insight, case configuration and simulation evaluation. Code insight is an alternative to traditional keyword searching leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and aims to enable efficient navigation and summarization of the FireFOAM source code for developers and experienced users. For case configuration, the agent interprets user requests in natural language and aims to modify existing simulation setups accordingly to support intermediate users. FoamPilot's job execution functionality seeks to manage the submission and execution of simulations in high-performance computing (HPC) environments and provide preliminary analysis of simulation results to support less experienced users. Promising results were achieved for each functionality, particularly for simple tasks, and opportunities were identified for significant further improvement for more complex tasks.

We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to generate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would significantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice that existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple tokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the conditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for few-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which uses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network to distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the training data of the original AR model, making it more http://practical.We evaluate DD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on ImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step generation (6.3$\\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8$\\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In both cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on text-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for LlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to demonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD challenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens up new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

This paper critically examines this claim, highlighting practical and theoretical limitations that undermine the validity of this conclusion. First, we question whether the evidence provided by Upadhyay et al. really supports their claim, particularly if a test collection is used asa benchmark for future improvements. Second, through a submission deliberately intended to do so, we demonstrate the ease with which automatic evaluation metrics can be subverted, showing that systems designed to exploit these evaluations can achieve artificially high scores. Theoretical challenges -- such as the inherent narcissism of LLMs, the risk of overfitting to LLM-based metrics, and the potential degradation of future LLM performance -- must be addressed before LLM-based relevance assessments can be considered a viable replacement for human judgments.",

To overcome these deficiencies, a natural solution is to generate images for unseen classes using text prompts. To this end, We present DIG-ZSL, a novel Discriminative Image Generation framework for Zero-Shot Learning. Specifically, to ensure the generation of discriminative images for training an effective ZSL classifier, we learn a discriminative class token (DCT) for each unseen class under the guidance of a pre-trained category discrimination model (CDM). Harnessing DCTs, we can generate diverse and high-quality images, which serve as informative unseen samples for ZSL tasks. In this paper, the extensive experiments and visualizations on four datasets show that our DIG-ZSL: (1) generates diverse and high-quality images, (2) outperforms previous state-of-the-art nonhuman-annotated semantic prototype-based methods by a large margin, and (3) achieves comparable or better performance than baselines that leverage human-annotated semantic prototypes.

        "abstract": "To enhance autonomous driving safety in complex scenarios, various methods have been proposed to simulate LiDAR point cloud data. Nevertheless, these methods often face challenges in producing high-quality, diverse, and controllable foreground objects. To address the needs of object-aware tasks in 3D perception, we introduce OLiDM, a novel framework capable of generating high-fidelity LiDAR data at both the object and the scene levels. OLiDM consists of two pivotal components: the Object-Scene Progressive Generation (OPG) module and the Object Semantic Alignment (OSA) module. OPG adapts to user-specific prompts to generate desired foreground objects, which are subsequently employed as conditions in scene generation, ensuring controllable outputs at both the object and scene levels. This also facilitates the association of user-defined object-level annotations with the generated LiDAR scenes. Moreover, OSA aims to rectify the misalignment between foreground objects and background scenes, enhancing the overall quality of the generated objects. The broad effectiveness of OLiDM is demonstrated across various LiDAR generation tasks, as well as in 3D perception tasks. Specifically, on the KITTI-360 dataset, OLiDM surpasses prior state-of-the-art methods such as UltraLiDAR by 17.5 in FPD. Additionally, in sparse-to-dense LiDAR completion, OLiDM achieves a significant improvement over LiDARGen, with a 57.47\\% increase in semantic IoU. Moreover, OLiDM enhances the performance of mainstream 3D detectors by 2.4\\% in mAP and 1.9\\% in NDS, underscoring its potential in advancing object-aware 3D tasks.

Here, we summarize the lessons learned from the competition ending on June 1, 2024 (the top 4 entrants also presented their experiences in a recorded webinar). The largest improvements in accuracy were achieved using an ensembling approach, where the output of multiple independent decoders was merged using a fine-tuned large language model (an approach used by all 3 top entrants). Performance gains were also found by improving how the baseline recurrent neural network (RNN) model was trained, including by optimizing learning rate scheduling and by using a diphone training objective. Improving upon the model architecture itself proved more difficult, however, with attempts to use deep state space models or transformers not yet appearing to offer a benefit over the RNN baseline. The benchmark will remain open indefinitely to support further work towards increasing the accuracy of brain-to-text algorithms.",

However, most existing multi-sensor fusion SLAM methods mainly use all of the data from a range of sensors, a strategy we refer to as the all-in method. This method, while merging the benefits of different sensors, also brings in their weaknesses, lowering the robustness and accuracy and leading to high computational demands. To address this, we propose a new fusion approach -- Selective Kalman Filter -- to carefully choose and fuse information from multiple sensors (using LiDAR and visual observations as examples in this paper). For deciding when to fuse data, we implement degeneracy detection in LiDAR SLAM, incorporating visual measurements only when LiDAR SLAM exhibits degeneracy. Regarding degeneracy detection, we propose an elegant yet straightforward approach to determine the degeneracy of LiDAR SLAM and to identify the specific degenerative direction. This method fully considers the coupled relationship between rotational and translational constraints. In terms of how to fuse data, we use visual measurements only to update the specific degenerative states. As a result, our proposed method improves upon the all-in method by greatly enhancing real-time performance due to less processing visual data, and it introduces fewer errors from visual measurements. Experiments demonstrate that our method for degeneracy detection and fusion, in addressing degeneracy issues, exhibits higher precision and robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers enhanced real-time performance relative to the all-in method. The code is openly available.",

Second, we investigate the transferability of detectors across domains and LLMs, leveraging fine-grained datasets to reveal insights into domain transferring and implementing few-shot techniques to improve the performance by roughly 13.2%. Third, we introduce a novel attribution task where models must adapt to new classes over time without (or with very limited) access to prior training data and benchmark detectors. We implement several adapting techniques to improve the performance by roughly 10% and highlight the inherent complexity of the task. Our findings provide insights into the generalization ability of MGT detectors across diverse scenarios and lay the foundation for building robust, adaptive detection systems.",

Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) have emerged as a critical tool for evaluating the privacy risks associated with these models. Although existing attack methods, such as LOSS, Reference-based, min-k, and zlib, perform well in certain scenarios, their effectiveness on large pre-trained language models often approaches random guessing, particularly in the context of large-scale datasets and single-epoch training. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel ensemble attack method that integrates several existing MIAs techniques (LOSS, Reference-based, min-k, zlib) into an XGBoost-based model to enhance overall attack performance (EM-MIAs). Experimental results demonstrate that the ensemble model significantly improves both AUC-ROC and accuracy compared to individual attack methods across various large language models and datasets. This indicates that by combining the strengths of different methods, we can more effectively identify members of the model's training data, thereby providing a more robust tool for evaluating the privacy risks of LLM. This study offers new directions for further research in the field of LLM privacy protection and underscores the necessity of developing more powerful privacy auditing methods.",

Traditional DR methods primarily depend on naive negative sampling techniques or on mining hard negatives through external retriever and meticulously crafted strategies. However, naive negative sampling often fails to adequately capture the accurate boundaries between positive and negative samples, whereas existing hard negative sampling methods are prone to false negatives, resulting in performance degradation and training instability. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer an innovative solution to these challenges by generating contextually rich and diverse negative samples. In this work, we present a framework that harnesses LLMs to synthesize high-quality hard negative samples. We first devise a \\textit{multi-attribute self-reflection prompting strategy} to direct LLMs in hard negative sample generation. Then, we implement a \\textit{hybrid sampling strategy} that integrates these synthetic negatives with traditionally retrieved negatives, thereby stabilizing the training process and improving retrieval performance. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, and code is also publicly available.",

The problem is defined as multiple depot pickup and delivery with time windows constrained over operational restrictions, such as vehicle battery limitation, precedence time window, and building obstruction. Subsequently, the coalition game theory is applied to investigate cooperation structures among the modes to capture how strategic collaboration among vehicles can improve overall routing efficiency. To do so, a generalized reinforcement learning model is designed to evaluate the cost-sharing and allocation to different coalitions for which sub-additive property and non-empty core exist. Our methodology leverages an end-to-end deep multi-agent policy gradient method augmented by a novel spatio-temporal adjacency neighbourhood graph attention network and transformer architecture using a heterogeneous edge-enhanced attention model. Conducting several numerical experiments on last-mile delivery applications, the result from the case study in the city of Mississauga shows that despite the incorporation of an extensive network in the graph for two modes and a complex training structure, the model addresses realistic operational constraints and achieves high-quality solutions compared with the existing transformer-based and heuristics methods and can perform well on non-homogeneous data distribution, generalizes well on the different scale and configuration, and demonstrate a robust performance under stochastic scenarios subject to wind speed and direction.",

Despite significant progress in handling complex environments using deep reinforcement learning, current PGN methods are designed for single-robot systems, limiting their generalizability to multi-robot scenarios with diverse platforms. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing a knowledge transfer framework for PGN, allowing a teacher robot to transfer its learned navigation model to student robots, including those with unknown or black-box platforms. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation (KD) framework that transfers first-person-view (FPV) representations (view images, turning/forward actions) to universally applicable third-person-view (TPV) representations (local maps, subgoals). The state is redefined as reconstructed local maps using SLAM, while actions are mapped to subgoals on a predefined grid. To enhance training efficiency, we propose a sampling-efficient KD approach that aligns training episodes via a noise-robust local map descriptor (LMD). Although validated on 2D wheeled robots, this method can be extended to 3D action spaces, such as drones. Experiments conducted in Habitat-Sim demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, requiring minimal implementation effort. This study highlights the potential for scalable and cross-platform PGN solutions, expanding the applicability of embodied AI systems in multi-robot scenarios.",

This limits the applications such as cinematic shot type plan or camera control. We propose a pose-correlated reference selection diffusion network, supporting substantial viewpoint variations in human animation. Our key idea is to enable the network to utilize multiple reference images as input, since significant viewpoint changes often lead to missing appearance details on the human body. To eliminate the computational cost, we first introduce a novel pose correlation module to compute similarities between non-aligned target and source poses, and then propose an adaptive reference selection strategy, utilizing the attention map to identify key regions for animation generation. To train our model, we curated a large dataset from public TED talks featuring varied shots of the same character, helping the model learn synthesis for different perspectives. Our experimental results show that with the same number of reference images, our model performs favorably compared to the current SOTA methods under large viewpoint change. We further show that the adaptive reference selection is able to choose the most relevant reference regions to generate humans under free viewpoints.",

        "abstract": "In human communication, both verbal and non-verbal cues play a crucial role in conveying emotions, intentions, and meaning beyond words alone. These non-linguistic information, such as facial expressions, eye contact, voice tone, and pitch, are fundamental elements of effective interactions, enriching conversations by adding emotional and contextual depth. Recognizing the importance of non-linguistic content in communication, we present AV-EmoDialog, a dialogue system designed to exploit verbal and non-verbal information from users' audio-visual inputs to generate more responsive and empathetic interactions. AV-EmoDialog systematically exploits the emotional cues in audio-visual dialogues; extracting speech content and emotional tones from speech, analyzing fine-grained facial expressions from visuals, and integrating these cues to generate emotionally aware responses in an end-to-end manner. Through extensive experiments, we validate that the proposed AV-EmoDialog outperforms existing multimodal LLMs in generating not only emotionally appropriate but also contextually appropriate responses.",

In such applications, prompts serve as the primary means of interacting with LLMs. Despite the widespread use of LLM-integrated applications, there is limited understanding of how developers manage and evolve prompts. This study presents the first empirical analysis of prompt evolution in LLM-integrated software development. We analyzed 1,262 prompt changes across 243 GitHub repositories to investigate the patterns and frequencies of prompt changes, their relationship with code changes, documentation practices, and their impact on system behavior. Our findings show that developers primarily evolve prompts through additions and modifications, with most changes occurring during feature development. We identified key challenges in prompt engineering: only 21.9\\% of prompt changes are documented in commit messages, changes can introduce logical inconsistencies, and misalignment often occurs between prompt changes and LLM responses. These insights emphasize the need for specialized testing frameworks, automated validation tools, and improved documentation practices to enhance the reliability of LLM-integrated applications.",

Earlier research introduced almost linear time, i.e., $n^{1+o(1)}$ where $n$ is the number of input tokens, algorithms for the forward computation under specific parameter settings. However, achieving a subquadratic time algorithm for other parameter regimes remains impossible unless the widely accepted Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) is disproven. In this work, we develop the first almost linear time algorithm for backward computations in the RoPE-based attention under bounded entries. Our approach builds on recent advancements in fast RoPE attention computations, utilizing a novel combination of the polynomial method and the Fast Fourier Transform.

Existing edit distance metrics, such as Levenshtein, BLEU, ROUGE, and TER, often fail to accurately measure the effort required for post-editing, especially when edits involve substantial modifications, such as block operations. In this paper, we introduce a novel compression-based edit distance metric grounded in the Lempel-Ziv-77 algorithm, designed to quantify the amount of post-editing applied to LLM-generated texts. Our method leverages the properties of text compression to measure the informational difference between the original and edited texts. Through experiments on real-world human edits datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed metric is highly correlated with actual edit time and effort. We also show that LLMs exhibit an implicit understanding of editing speed, that aligns well with our metric. Furthermore, we compare our metric with existing ones, highlighting its advantages in capturing complex edits with linear computational efficiency.

Recent research indicates that LLMs (large language models) exhibit significant potential in metaphor detection. Nevertheless, their reasoning capabilities are constrained by predefined knowledge graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DMD, a novel dual-perspective framework that harnesses both implicit and explicit applications of metaphor theories to guide LLMs in metaphor detection and adopts a self-judgment mechanism to validate the responses from the aforementioned forms of guidance. In comparison to previous methods, our framework offers more transparent reasoning processes and delivers more reliable predictions.

Recent GAN-based methods fall short of the call, as the methods either require special information such as geological traits or generate subpar waveforms that fail to satisfy seismological constraints such as phase arrival times. We propose a specialized Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) that reliably generates realistic waveforms after learning from real earthquake data with minimal conditions: location and magnitude. We also design a domain-specific training method that exploits the traits of earthquake dataset: multiple observed waveforms time-aligned and paired to each earthquake source that are tagged with seismological metadata comprised of earthquake magnitude, depth of focus, and the locations of epicenter and seismometers. We construct the time-aligned earthquake dataset using Southern California Earthquake Data Center (SCEDC) API, and train our model with the dataset and our proposed training method for performance evaluation. Our model surpasses all comparable data-driven methods in various test criteria not only from waveform generation domain but also from seismology such as phase arrival time, GMPE analysis, and spectrum analysis. Our result opens new future research directions for deep learning applications in seismology.",

Sensors like cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) are significantly limited under these conditions, whereas ultrasonic sensors offer a more robust alternative. However, the low angular resolution, slow update frequency, and limited detection accuracy of ultrasonic sensors present barriers for SLAM. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end generative ultrasonic SLAM framework. This framework employs a sensor array with overlapping fields of view, leveraging the inherently low angular resolution of ultrasonic sensors to implicitly encode spatial features in conjunction with the robot's motion. Consecutive time frame data is processed through a sliding window mechanism to capture temporal features. The spatiotemporally encoded sensor data is passed through multiple modules to generate dense scan point clouds and robot pose transformations for map construction and odometry. The main contributions of this work include a novel ultrasonic sensor array that spatiotemporally encodes the surrounding environment, and an end-to-end generative SLAM framework that overcomes the inherent defects of ultrasonic sensors. Several real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed framework.",

The number of resets depends on the configuration of the physical environment; thus, inappropriate object placement can lead to frequent resets, causing motion sickness and degrading presence. However, estimating the number of resets based on the physical layout is challenging. It is difficult to measure reset frequency with real users repeatedly testing different layouts, and virtual simulations offer limited real-time verification. As a result, while rearranging objects can reduce resets, users have not been able to fully take advantage of this opportunity, highlighting the need for rapid assessment of object placement. To address this, in Study 1, we collected simulation data and analyzed the average number of resets for various object placements. In study 2, we developed a system that allows users to evaluate reset frequency using a real-time placement interface powered by the first learning-based reset prediction model. Our model predicts resets from top-down views of the physical space, leveraging a Vision Transformer architecture. The model achieved a root mean square error (RMSE) of $23.88$. We visualized the model's attention scores using heatmaps to analyze the regions of focus during prediction. Through the interface, users can reorganize furniture while instantly observing the change in the predicted number of resets, thus improving their interior for a better RDW experience with fewer resets.",

We introduce Balanced 3DGS, a Gaussian-wise parallelism rendering with fine-grained tiling approach in 3DGS training process, perfectly solving load-imbalance issues. First, we innovatively introduce the inter-block dynamic workload distribution technique to map workloads to Streaming Multiprocessor(SM) resources within a single GPU dynamically, which constitutes the foundation of load balancing. Second, we are the first to propose the Gaussian-wise parallel rendering technique to significantly reduce workload divergence inside a warp, which serves as a critical component in addressing load imbalance. Based on the above two methods, we further creatively put forward the fine-grained combined load balancing technique to uniformly distribute workload across all SMs, which boosts the forward renderCUDA kernel performance by up to 7.52x. Besides, we present a self-adaptive render kernel selection strategy during the 3DGS training process based on different load-balance situations, which effectively improves training efficiency.",

To this end, we propose a model-agnostic PEFT framework, IMSM, which Interweaves Memories of a Siamese Large Language Model. Specifically, our siamese LLM is equipped with an existing PEFT method. Given an incoming query, it generates two distinct memories based on the pre-trained and fine-tuned parameters. IMSM then incorporates an interweaving mechanism that regulates the contributions of both original and enhanced memories when generating the next token. This framework is theoretically applicable to all open-source LLMs and existing PEFT methods. We conduct extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets, evaluating the performance of popular open-source LLMs using the proposed IMSM, in comparison to both classical and leading PEFT methods. Our findings indicate that IMSM maintains comparable time and space efficiency to backbone PEFT methods while significantly improving performance and effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting.",

Moreover, most compression techniques for generative models have been developed primarily for GANs, tailored to specific architectures like StyleGAN, and research into compressing Diffusion models has just begun. Even more, these methods are often applicable only to GANs or Diffusion models, highlighting the need for approaches that work across both model types. In this paper, we introduce Singular Value Scaling (SVS), a versatile technique for refining pruned weights, applicable to both model types. Our analysis reveals that pruned weights often exhibit dominant singular vectors, hindering fine-tuning efficiency and leading to suboptimal performance compared to random initialization. Our method enhances weight initialization by minimizing the disparities between singular values of pruned weights, thereby improving the fine-tuning process. This approach not only guides the compressed model toward superior solutions but also significantly speeds up fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on StyleGAN2, StyleGAN3 and DDPM demonstrate that SVS improves compression performance across model types without additional training costs.

At the first stage, the self-correction reasoning ability of an LLM is enhanced through its own predictions, relying entirely on self-generated data within the intrinsic self-correction to some extent. At the second stage, the baseline step-wise preference learning is leveraged via the application of the enhanced self-correct policy achieved at the first stage. In the evaluation of arithmetic reasoning tasks, our approach outperforms OpenMath2-Llama3.1-8B, dart-math-mistral-7b-uniform on MATH with increases in accuracy to 71.34%(+4.18%) and 48.06%(+4.94%) and LLama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1 on GSM8K with increases in accuracy to 86.76%(+2.00%) and 38.06%(+2.28%).",

However, they sometimes produce misleading or hallucinate content due to discrepancies between their pre-training data and real user prompts. Existing approaches using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in vision-language tasks often rely on strong models like GPT-4 or CLIP to determine positive and negative responses. Here, we propose a new framework in generating synthetic data using a reward model as a proxy of human preference for effective multimodal alignment with DPO training. The resulting DPO dataset ranges from 2K to 9K image-text pairs, was evaluated on LLaVA-v1.5-7B, where our approach demonstrated substantial improvements in both the trustworthiness and reasoning capabilities of the base model across multiple hallucination and vision-language benchmark. The experiment results indicate that integrating selected synthetic data, such as from generative and rewards models can effectively reduce reliance on human-annotated data while enhancing MLLMs' alignment capability, offering a scalable solution for safer deployment.",

        "abstract": "LLMs demonstrate significant potential across various software engineering tasks. However, they still face challenges in generating correct code on the first attempt when addressing complex requirements. Introducing a discriminator to select reliable outputs from multiple generated results is an effective way to enhance their reliability and stability. Currently, these discriminators fall into two categories: execution-based discriminators and non-execution-based discriminators. Execution-based discriminators face flexibility challenges due to difficulties in obtaining test cases and security concerns, while non-execution-based discriminators, although more flexible, struggle to capture subtle differences in code details. To maintain flexibility while improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained code details, this paper proposes Condor. We first design contrastive learning to optimize the code representations of the base model, enabling it to reflect differences in code details. Then, we leverage intermediate data from the code modification process to further enrich the discriminator's training data, enhancing its ability to discern code details. Experimental results indicate that on the subtle code difference dataset (i.e., CodeNanoFix), Condor significantly outperforms other discriminators in discriminative performance: Condor (1.3B) improves the discriminative F1 score of DeepSeek-Coder (1.3B) from 67% to 73%. In discriminating LLM-generated outputs, Condor (1.3B) and Condor (110M) raise the Pass@1 score of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the CodeNanoFix dataset from 52.64% to 62.63% and 59.64%, respectively. Moreover, Condor demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on the MBPP and APPS datasets. For example, Condor (1.3B) improves the Pass@1 of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the APPS dataset by 147.05%.",

The paper describes in detail the chosen algorithm for BERTopic, which included creating a vector space from a corpus of therapist remarks, reducing its dimensionality, clustering the space, and creating and optimizing topic representation. Along with the automatic topical modeling by the BERTopic, the research involved an expert assessment of the findings and manual topic structure optimization. The topic modeling results highlighted the most common and stable topics in therapists speech, offering insights into how language patterns in therapy develop and remain stable across different therapeutic styles. This work contributes to the growing field of machine learning in psychotherapy by demonstrating the potential of automated methods to improve both the practice and training of therapists.

Furthermore, we identify three key failure patterns: lost by the boundary, lost if surprise, and lost along the way.

We focus on two objectives: minimizing GPU fragmentation and reducing power consumption. GPU fragmentation occurs when partial GPU allocations hinder the efficient use of remaining resources, especially as the datacenter nears full capacity. A recent scheduling policy, Fragmentation Gradient Descent (FGD), leverages a fragmentation metric to address this issue. Reducing power consumption is also crucial due to the significant power demands of GPUs. To this end, we propose PWR, a novel scheduling policy to minimize power usage by selecting power-efficient GPU and CPU combinations. This involves a simplified model for measuring power consumption integrated into a Kubernetes score plugin. Through an extensive experimental evaluation in a simulated cluster, we show how PWR, when combined with FGD, achieves a balanced trade-off between reducing power consumption and minimizing GPU fragmentation.",

        "abstract": "Recently, O1-like models have emerged as representative examples, illustrating the effectiveness of long chain-of-thought (CoT) in reasoning tasks such as math and coding tasks. In this paper, we introduce DRT-o1, an attempt to bring the success of long CoT to neural machine translation (MT). Specifically, in view of the literature books that might involve similes and metaphors, translating these texts to a target language is very difficult in practice due to cultural differences. In such cases, literal translation often fails to convey the intended meaning effectively. Even for professional human translators, considerable thought must be given to preserving semantics throughout the translation process. To simulate LLMs' long thought ability in MT, we first mine sentences containing similes or metaphors from existing literature books, and then develop a multi-agent framework to translate these sentences via long thought. In the multi-agent framework, a translator is used to iteratively translate the source sentence under the suggestions provided by an advisor. To ensure the effectiveness of the long thoughts, an evaluator is also employed to judge whether the translation in the current round is better than the previous one or not. In this manner, we collect tens of thousands of long-thought MT data, which is used to train our DRT-o1. The experimental results on literature translation demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRT-o1. Using Qwen2.5-7B and Qwen2.5-14B as the backbones, the improvement brought by DRT-o1 achieves 7.33~8.26 BLEU and 1.66~3.36 CometScore. Besides, DRT-o1-7B can outperform QwQ-32B-Preview by 7.82 BLEU and 1.46 CometScore, showing its effectiveness. The project is available at https://github.com/krystalan/DRT-o1",

As LLMs become more powerful, studying jailbreak methods is critical to enhancing security and aligning models with human values. Traditionally, jailbreak techniques have relied on suffix addition or prompt templates, but these methods suffer from limited attack diversity. This paper introduces DiffusionAttacker, an end-to-end generative approach for jailbreak rewriting inspired by diffusion models. Our method employs a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) text diffusion model as a generator, conditioning on the original prompt and guiding the denoising process with a novel attack loss. Unlike previous approaches that use autoregressive LLMs to generate jailbreak prompts, which limit the modification of already generated tokens and restrict the rewriting space, DiffusionAttacker utilizes a seq2seq diffusion model, allowing more flexible token modifications. This approach preserves the semantic content of the original prompt while producing harmful content. Additionally, we leverage the Gumbel-Softmax technique to make the sampling process from the diffusion model's output distribution differentiable, eliminating the need for iterative token search. Extensive experiments on Advbench and Harmbench demonstrate that DiffusionAttacker outperforms previous methods across various evaluation metrics, including attack success rate (ASR), fluency, and diversity.",

Model compression has emerged as a mainstream solution to reduce memory usage and computational overhead. This paper presents Group Quantization and Sparse Acceleration (\\textbf{GQSA}), a novel compression technique tailored for LLMs. Traditional methods typically focus exclusively on either quantization or sparsification, but relying on a single strategy often results in significant performance loss at high compression rates. In contrast, GQSA integrates quantization and sparsification in a tightly coupled manner, leveraging GPU-friendly structured group sparsity and quantization for efficient acceleration. The proposed method consists of three key steps. First, GQSA applies group structured pruning to adhere to GPU-friendly sparse pattern constraints. Second, a two-stage sparsity-aware training process is employed to maximize performance retention after compression. Finally, the framework adopts the Block Sparse Row (BSR) format to enable practical deployment and efficient execution. Experimental results on the LLaMA model family show that GQSA achieves an excellent balance between model speed and accuracy. Furthermore, on the latest LLaMA-3 and LLaMA-3.1 models, GQSA outperforms existing LLM compression techniques significantly.",

        "abstract": "Masked autoencoders (MAE) have recently succeeded in self-supervised vision representation learning. Previous work mainly applied custom-designed (e.g., random, block-wise) masking or teacher (e.g., CLIP)-guided masking and targets. However, they ignore the potential role of the self-training (student) model in giving feedback to the teacher for masking and targets. In this work, we present to integrate Collaborative Masking and Targets for boosting Masked AutoEncoders, namely CMT-MAE. Specifically, CMT-MAE leverages a simple collaborative masking mechanism through linear aggregation across attentions from both teacher and student models. We further propose using the output features from those two models as the collaborative target of the decoder. Our simple and effective framework pre-trained on ImageNet-1K achieves state-of-the-art linear probing and fine-tuning performance. In particular, using ViT-base, we improve the fine-tuning results of the vanilla MAE from 83.6% to 85.7%.",

With two advanced automated pipelines for video annotation and distractor-included QA generation, HumanVBench utilizes diverse state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques to streamline benchmark data synthesis and quality assessment, minimizing human annotation dependency tailored to human-centric multimodal attributes. A comprehensive evaluation across 16 SOTA video MLLMs reveals notable limitations in current performance, especially in cross-modal and temporal alignment, underscoring the necessity for further refinement toward achieving more human-like understanding.

Through extensive experimentation with 20 leading models across 1,180 keywords spanning 18 scientific domains, we reveal that scientific creative ability shows distinct patterns from general intelligence metrics. Notably, our results demonstrate that models like QwQ-32B-preview achieve comparable creative performance to top-tier models like o1-preview, despite significant gaps in their general intelligence scores.

Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the more challenging image-level annotations and propose an adaptive frequency-aware network (AFANet) for weakly-supervised few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS). Specifically, we first propose a cross-granularity frequency-aware module (CFM) that decouples RGB images into high-frequency and low-frequency distributions and further optimizes semantic structural information by realigning them. Unlike most existing WFSS methods using the textual information from the multi-modal language-vision model, e.g., CLIP, in an offline learning manner, we further propose a CLIP-guided spatial-adapter module (CSM), which performs spatial domain adaptive transformation on textual information through online learning, thus providing enriched cross-modal semantic information for CFM.

Second, when practitioners must perform forecasting on a new dataset, a nontrivial first step is often to find an appropriate forecasting method. EasyTime provides an Automated Ensemble module that combines the promising forecasting methods to yield superior forecasting accuracy compared to individual methods. Third, EasyTime offers a natural language Q&A module leveraging large language models.

To address this, we leverage the rich visual priors of a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model and propose a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline to adapt the SD model for stable and efficient shadow removal. In the first stage, we fix the VAE and fine-tune the denoiser in latent space, which yields substantial shadow removal but may lose some high-frequency details. To resolve this, we introduce a second stage, called the detail injection stage. This stage selectively extracts features from the VAE encoder to modulate the decoder, injecting fine details into the final results. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art shadow removal techniques. The cross-dataset evaluation further demonstrates that our method generalizes effectively to unseen data, enhancing the applicability of shadow removal methods.",

Most existing works primarily focus on rendering 2D feature maps from novel viewpoints, which leads to an imprecise 3D language field with outlier languages, ultimately failing to align objects in 3D space. By utilizing masked images for feature extraction, these approaches also lack essential contextual information, leading to inaccurate feature representation. To this end, we propose a Language-Embedded Surface Field (LangSurf), which accurately aligns the 3D language fields with the surface of objects, facilitating precise 2D and 3D segmentation with text query, widely expanding the downstream tasks such as removal and editing. The core of LangSurf is a joint training strategy that flattens the language Gaussian on the object surfaces using geometry supervision and contrastive losses to assign accurate language features to the Gaussians of objects. In addition, we also introduce the Hierarchical-Context Awareness Module to extract features at the image level for contextual information then perform hierarchical mask pooling using masks segmented by SAM to obtain fine-grained language features in different hierarchies. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary 2D and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that LangSurf outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LangSplat by a large margin. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:teaser}, our method is capable of segmenting objects in 3D space, thus boosting the effectiveness of our approach in instance recognition, removal, and editing, which is also supported by comprehensive experiments. \\url{https://langsurf.github.io}{Project Page}.",

However, methods to evaluate and benchmark the performance of different Video LLMs, especially their fine-grained, temporal visual capabilities, remain very limited. On one hand, current benchmarks use relatively simple videos (e.g., subtitled movie clips) where the model can understand the entire video by processing just a few frames. On the other hand, their datasets lack diversity in task format, comprising only QA or multi-choice QA, which overlooks the models' capacity for generating in-depth and precise texts. Sports videos, which feature intricate visual information, sequential events, and emotionally charged commentary, present a critical challenge for Video LLMs, making sports commentary an ideal benchmarking task. Inspired by these challenges, we propose a novel task: sports video commentary generation, developed $\\textbf{SCBench}$ for Video LLMs. To construct such a benchmark, we introduce (1) $\\textbf{SCORES}$, a six-dimensional metric specifically designed for our task, upon which we propose a GPT-based evaluation method, and (2) $\\textbf{CommentarySet}$, a dataset consisting of 5,775 annotated video clips and ground-truth labels tailored to our metric. Based on SCBench, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on multiple Video LLMs (e.g. VILA, Video-LLaVA, etc.) and chain-of-thought baseline methods. Our results found that InternVL-Chat-2 achieves the best performance with 5.44, surpassing the second-best by 1.04.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel method, termed Hierarchical Vector Quantization (\\ours), that consists of two subsequent vector quantization modules. This results in a hierarchical clustering where the additional subclusters cover the variations within a cluster. We demonstrate that our approach captures the distribution of segment lengths much better than the state of the art. To this end, we introduce a new metric based on the Jensen-Shannon Distance (JSD) for unsupervised temporal action segmentation. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets, namely Breakfast, YouTube Instructional and IKEA ASM. Our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of F1 score, recall and JSD.",

However, existing methods often face a dilemma: lightweight approaches, such as adapters, are prone to generate inconsistent textures; while finetune-based methods involve high training costs and struggle to maintain the generalization capabilities of pretrained diffusion models, limiting their performance across diverse scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose DreamFit, which incorporates a lightweight Anything-Dressing Encoder specifically tailored for the garment-centric human generation. DreamFit has three key advantages: (1) \\textbf{Lightweight training}: with the proposed adaptive attention and LoRA modules, DreamFit significantly minimizes the model complexity to 83.4M trainable parameters. (2)\\textbf{Anything-Dressing}: Our model generalizes surprisingly well to a wide range of (non-)garments, creative styles, and prompt instructions, consistently delivering high-quality results across diverse scenarios. (3) \\textbf{Plug-and-play}: DreamFit is engineered for smooth integration with any community control plugins for diffusion models, ensuring easy compatibility and minimizing adoption barriers. To further enhance generation quality, DreamFit leverages pretrained large multi-modal models (LMMs) to enrich the prompt with fine-grained garment descriptions, thereby reducing the prompt gap between training and inference. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both $768 \\times 512$ high-resolution benchmarks and in-the-wild images. DreamFit surpasses all existing methods, highlighting its state-of-the-art capabilities of garment-centric human generation.",

To address this issue, we explore the use of sequence-to-sequence LLMs for completing fragmented Broca's aphasic sentences. We first generate synthetic Broca's aphasic data using a rule-based system designed to mirror the linguistic characteristics of Broca's aphasic speech. Using this synthetic data, we then fine-tune four pre-trained LLMs on the task of completing fragmented sentences. We evaluate our fine-tuned models on both synthetic and authentic Broca's aphasic data. We demonstrate LLMs' capability for reconstructing fragmented sentences, with the models showing improved performance with longer input utterances.

We believe this limitation is largely due to inadequate training data quality. While most research focuses on developing new algorithms, less attention is given to training data selection, despite evidence that performance can be strongly impacted by spurious correlations such as content, format, or resolution. A well-designed forensic detector should detect generator specific artifacts rather than reflect data biases. To this end, we propose B-Free, a bias-free training paradigm, where fake images are generated from real ones using the conditioning procedure of stable diffusion models. This ensures semantic alignment between real and fake images, allowing any differences to stem solely from the subtle artifacts introduced by AI generation. Through content-based augmentation, we show significant improvements in both generalization and robustness over state-of-the-art detectors and more calibrated results across 27 different generative models, including recent releases, like FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3.5. Our findings emphasize the importance of a careful dataset curation, highlighting the need for further research in dataset design.

While this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic expression that characterizes its semantics? How do the semantics of two losses relate to each other? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful guidance to those working on human AI alignment.",

GaussianPainter introduces an innovative feed-forward approach to overcome the limitations of time-consuming test-time optimization in 3D Gaussian splatting. Our method addresses a critical challenge in the field: the non-uniqueness problem inherent in the large parameter space of 3D Gaussian splatting. This space, encompassing rotation, anisotropic scales, and spherical harmonic coefficients, introduces the challenge of rendering similar images from substantially different Gaussian fields. As a result, feed-forward networks face instability when attempting to directly predict high-quality Gaussian fields, struggling to converge on consistent parameters for a given output. To address this issue, we propose to estimate a surface normal for each point to determine its Gaussian rotation. This strategy enables the network to effectively predict the remaining Gaussian parameters in the constrained space. We further enhance our approach with an appearance injection module, incorporating reference image appearance into Gaussian fields via a multiscale triplane representation. Our method successfully balances efficiency and fidelity in 3D Gaussian generation, achieving high-quality, diverse, and robust 3D content creation from point clouds in a single forward pass.",

Specifically, our approach leverages an Encoder-Decoder backbone, augmented with two submodules for extracting these latent spaces, respectively. The first submodule employs a Q-Former to extract low-frequency motion trends, followed by downsampling blocks to remove redundant content details. The second averages the latent vectors along the spatial dimension to capture rapid motion. Extensive experiments show that VidTwin achieves a high compression rate of 0.20% with high reconstruction quality (PSNR of 28.14 on the MCL-JCV dataset), and performs efficiently and effectively in downstream generative tasks. Moreover, our model demonstrates explainability and scalability, paving the way for future research in video latent representation and generation.

However, keeping these models up-to-date with evolving world knowledge remains a significant challenge due to the high costs of frequent retraining. To address this challenge, knowledge editing techniques have emerged to update LLMs with new information without rebuilding the model from scratch. Among these, the in-context editing paradigm stands out for its effectiveness in integrating new knowledge while preserving the model's original capabilities. Despite its potential, existing in-context knowledge editing methods are often task-specific, focusing primarily on multi-hop QA tasks using structured knowledge triples. Moreover, their reliance on few-shot prompting for task decomposition makes them unstable and less effective in generalizing across diverse tasks.\nIn response to these limitations, we propose EditCoT, a novel knowledge editing framework that flexibly and efficiently updates LLMs across various tasks without retraining. EditCoT works by generating a chain-of-thought (CoT) for a given input and then iteratively refining this CoT process using a CoT editor based on updated knowledge. We evaluate EditCoT across a diverse range of benchmarks, covering multiple languages and tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while offering superior generalization, effectiveness, and stability compared to existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field of knowledge updating.

However, the standard approaches generate sequences of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a range of reasoning-intensive tasks.",

        "abstract": "ARC Challenge appears more difficult than ARC Easy for modern LLMs primarily due to an evaluation setup that prevents direct comparison of answer choices rather than inherent complexity. Although some researchers have quietly shifted to a more appropriate scheme over the last year, the implications of this change have yet to be widely acknowledged. We highlight this overlooked shift, show how similar evaluation practices falsely imply reasoning deficits in other benchmarks, and demonstrate that fairer methods dramatically reduce performance gaps (e.g. on SIQA) and even yield superhuman results (OpenBookQA). In doing so, we reveal how evaluation shapes perceived difficulty and offer guidelines to ensure that multiple-choice evaluations accurately reflect actual model capabilities.",

In this paper, we cast the problem of combining multiple pre-trained diffusion models at the generation stage under a novel proposed framework termed superposition. Theoretically, we derive superposition from rigorous first principles stemming from the celebrated continuity equation and design two novel algorithms tailor-made for combining diffusion models in SuperDiff. SuperDiff leverages a new scalable It√¥ density estimator for the log likelihood of the diffusion SDE which incurs no additional overhead compared to the well-known Hutchinson's estimator needed for divergence calculations. We demonstrate that SuperDiff is scalable to large pre-trained diffusion models as superposition is performed solely through composition during inference, and also enjoys painless implementation as it combines different pre-trained vector fields through an automated re-weighting scheme. Notably, we show that SuperDiff is efficient during inference time, and mimics traditional composition operators such as the logical OR and the logical AND. We empirically demonstrate the utility of using SuperDiff for generating more diverse images on CIFAR-10, more faithful prompt conditioned image editing using Stable Diffusion, and improved unconditional de novo structure design of proteins. https://github.com/necludov/super-diffusion",

Directly applying image VAEs to individual frames in isolation can result in temporal inconsistencies and suboptimal compression rates due to a lack of temporal compression. Existing Video VAEs have begun to address temporal compression; however, they often suffer from inadequate reconstruction performance. In this paper, we present a novel and powerful video autoencoder capable of high-fidelity video encoding. First, we observe that entangling spatial and temporal compression by merely extending the image VAE to a 3D VAE can introduce motion blur and detail distortion artifacts. Thus, we propose temporal-aware spatial compression to better encode and decode the spatial information. Additionally, we integrate a lightweight motion compression model for further temporal compression. Second, we propose to leverage the textual information inherent in text-to-video datasets and incorporate text guidance into our model. This significantly enhances reconstruction quality, particularly in terms of detail preservation and temporal stability. Third, we further improve the versatility of our model through joint training on both images and videos, which not only enhances reconstruction quality but also enables the model to perform both image and video autoencoding. Extensive evaluations against strong recent baselines demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

However, the widely adopted uniform point sampling strategy in Shape VAE training often leads to a significant loss of geometric details, limiting the quality of shape reconstruction and downstream generation tasks. We present Dora-VAE, a novel approach that enhances VAE reconstruction through our proposed sharp edge sampling strategy and a dual cross-attention mechanism. By identifying and prioritizing regions with high geometric complexity during training, our method significantly improves the preservation of fine-grained shape features. Such sampling strategy and the dual attention mechanism enable the VAE to focus on crucial geometric details that are typically missed by uniform sampling approaches. To systematically evaluate VAE reconstruction quality, we additionally propose Dora-bench, a benchmark that quantifies shape complexity through the density of sharp edges, introducing a new metric focused on reconstruction accuracy at these salient geometric features. Extensive experiments on the Dora-bench demonstrate that Dora-VAE achieves comparable reconstruction quality to the state-of-the-art dense XCube-VAE while requiring a latent space at least 8$\\times$ smaller (1,280 vs. > 10,000 codes).

However, transformer attention operators often impose a significant computational burden, with the computational complexity scaling quadratically with the number of tokens. In this work, we propose a novel transformer attention operator whose computational complexity scales linearly with the number of tokens. We derive our network architecture by extending prior work which has shown that a transformer style architecture naturally arises by \"white-box\" architecture design, where each layer of the network is designed to implement an incremental optimization step of a maximal coding rate reduction objective (MCR$^2$). Specifically, we derive a novel variational form of the MCR$^2$ objective and show that the architecture that results from unrolled gradient descent of this variational objective leads to a new attention module called Token Statistics Self-Attention (TSSA). TSSA has linear computational and memory complexity and radically departs from the typical attention architecture that computes pairwise similarities between tokens. Experiments on vision, language, and long sequence tasks show that simply swapping TSSA for standard self-attention, which we refer to as the Token Statistics Transformer (ToST), achieves competitive performance with conventional transformers while being significantly more computationally efficient and interpretable. Our results also somewhat call into question the conventional wisdom that pairwise similarity style attention mechanisms are critical to the success of transformer architectures.

Unlike previous methods that struggle in real-world scenarios or lack interactive editing capabilities, ChatGarment can estimate sewing patterns from in-the-wild images or sketches, generate them from text descriptions, and edit garments based on user instructions, all within an interactive dialogue. These sewing patterns can then be draped into 3D garments, which are easily animatable and simulatable. This is achieved by finetuning a VLM to directly generate a JSON file that includes both textual descriptions of garment types and styles, as well as continuous numerical attributes. This JSON file is then used to create sewing patterns through a programming parametric model. To support this, we refine the existing programming model, GarmentCode, by expanding its garment type coverage and simplifying its structure for efficient VLM fine-tuning. Additionally, we construct a large-scale dataset of image-to-sewing-pattern and text-to-sewing-pattern pairs through an automated data pipeline. Extensive evaluations demonstrate ChatGarment's ability to accurately reconstruct, generate, and edit garments from multimodal inputs, highlighting its potential to revolutionize workflows in fashion and gaming applications.

To train our system, we develop a dataset of multi-view renderings using synthetic 3D human head as-sets. The diffusion-based multi-view generator is trained exclusively on synthetic head images, while the GS-LRM reconstructor undergoes initial training on Objaverse followed by fine-tuning on synthetic head data. FaceLift excels at preserving identity and maintaining view consistency across views. Despite being trained solely on synthetic data, FaceLift demonstrates remarkable generalization to real-world images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we show that FaceLift outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D head reconstruction, highlighting its practical applicability and robust performance on real-world images. In addition to single image reconstruction, FaceLift supports video inputs for 4D novel view synthesis and seamlessly integrates with 2D reanimation techniques to enable 3D facial animation.

However, this process is often computationally expensive and time-consuming. An alternative approach involves transforming PDEs into integral equations and solving them using Green's functions, which provide analytical solutions. Nevertheless, deriving Green's functions analytically is a challenging and non-trivial task, particularly for complex systems. In this study, we introduce a novel framework, termed GreensONet, which is constructed based on the strucutre of deep operator networks (DeepONet) to learn embedded Green's functions and solve PDEs via Green's integral formulation. Specifically, the Trunk Net within GreensONet is designed to approximate the unknown Green's functions of the system, while the Branch Net are utilized to approximate the auxiliary gradients of the Green's function. These outputs are subsequently employed to perform surface integrals and volume integrals, incorporating user-defined boundary conditions and source terms, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on three types of PDEs in bounded domains: 3D heat conduction equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Stokes equations. Comparative results in these cases demonstrate that GreenONet's accuracy and generalization ability surpass those of existing methods, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN), DeepONet, Physics-Informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet), and Fourier Neural Operators (FNO).",

In this paper, we explore the influence of three key factors separately by transiting the modality from text to speech in an evolving manner. Our findings reveal that the impact of the three factors varies. Factor A has a relatively minor impact, factor B influences syntactical and semantic modeling more obviously, and factor C exerts the most significant impact, particularly in the basic lexical modeling.

        "abstract": "High-fidelity speech enhancement often requires sophisticated modeling to capture intricate, multiscale patterns. Standard activation functions, while introducing nonlinearity, lack the flexibility to fully address this complexity. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), an emerging methodology that employs learnable activation functions on graph edges, present a promising alternative. This work investigates two novel KAN variants based on rational and radial basis functions for speech enhancement. We integrate the rational variant into the 1D CNN blocks of Demucs and the GRU-Transformer blocks of MP-SENet, while the radial variant is adapted to the 2D CNN-based decoders of MP-SENet. Experiments on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset show that replacing standard activations with KAN-based activations improves speech quality across both the time-domain and time-frequency domain methods with minimal impact on model size and FLOP, underscoring KAN's potential to improve speech enhancement models.",
