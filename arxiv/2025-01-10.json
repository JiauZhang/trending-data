        "abstract": "Coping with the impact of dynamic channels is a critical issue in joint source-channel coding (JSCC)-based semantic communication systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight channel-adaptive semantic coding architecture called SNR-EQ-JSCC. It is built upon the generic Transformer model and achieves channel adaptation (CA) by Embedding the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) into the attention blocks and dynamically adjusting attention scores through channel-adaptive Queries. Meanwhile, penalty terms are introduced in the loss function to stabilize the training process. Considering that instantaneous SNR feedback may be imperfect, we propose an alternative method that uses only the average SNR, which requires no retraining of SNR-EQ-JSCC. Simulation results conducted on image transmission demonstrate that the proposed SNR-EQJSCC outperforms the state-of-the-art SwinJSCC in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and perception metrics while only requiring 0.05% of the storage overhead and 6.38% of the computational complexity for CA. Moreover, the channel-adaptive query method demonstrates significant improvements in perception metrics. When instantaneous SNR feedback is imperfect, SNR-EQ-JSCC using only the average SNR still surpasses baseline schemes.",

Efficient knowledge transfer requires matching the mental model of the human teacher with the capabilities of the robot learner. This paper introduces the Mental Model Mismatch (MMM) Score, a feedback mechanism designed to quantify and reduce mismatches by aligning human teaching behavior with robot learning behavior. Using Large Language Models (LLMs), we analyze teacher intentions in natural language to generate adaptive feedback. A study with 150 participants teaching a virtual robot to solve a puzzle game shows that intention-based feedback significantly outperforms traditional performance-based feedback or no feedback. The results suggest that intention-based feedback improves instructional outcomes, improves understanding of the robot's learning process and reduces misconceptions. This research addresses a critical gap in human-robot interaction (HRI) by providing a method to quantify and mitigate discrepancies between human mental models and robot capabilities, with the goal of improving robot learning and human teaching effectiveness.",

We review the error bounds for Newton's polynomial, which is then generalized to an arbitrary spline, under Lipschitz continuity assumptions. We then extend these bounds to nested compositions of splines, arriving at error bounds for KANs. We evaluate our method by estimating an object's shape from sparse laser scan points. We use KAN to fit a smooth function to the scans and provide error bounds for the fit.

        "abstract": "Diffusion models have emerged as the mainstream approach for visual generation. However, these models usually suffer from sample inefficiency and high training costs. This issue is particularly pronounced in the standard diffusion transformer architecture due to its quadratic complexity relative to input length. Recent works have addressed this by reducing the number of tokens processed in the model, often through masking. In contrast, this work aims to improve the training efficiency of the diffusion backbone by using predefined routes that store this information until it is reintroduced to deeper layers of the model, rather than discarding these tokens entirely. Further, we combine multiple routes and introduce an adapted auxiliary loss that accounts for all applied routes. Our method is not limited to the common transformer-based model - it can also be applied to state-space models. Unlike most current approaches, TREAD achieves this without architectural modifications. Finally, we show that our method reduces the computational cost and simultaneously boosts model performance on the standard benchmark ImageNet-1K 256 x 256 in class-conditional synthesis. Both of these benefits multiply to a convergence speedup of 9.55x at 400K training iterations compared to DiT and 25.39x compared to the best benchmark performance of DiT at 7M training iterations.",

However, the impact of requirements formulation on LLM performance remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the role of requirements smells-indicators of potential issues like ambiguity and inconsistency-when used in prompts for LLMs. We conducted experiments using two LLMs focusing on automated trace link generation between requirements and code. Our results show mixed outcomes: while requirements smells had a small but significant effect when predicting whether a requirement was implemented in a piece of code (i.e., a trace link exists), no significant effect was observed when tracing the requirements with the associated lines of code. These findings suggest that requirements smells can affect LLM performance in certain SE tasks but may not uniformly impact all tasks. We highlight the need for further research to understand these nuances and propose future work toward developing guidelines for mitigating the negative effects of requirements smells in AI-driven SE processes.",

Shared probabilistic, concept-lattice, and hypervector models enable symbolic-subsymbolic integration.\nKey features include (1) compositional reasoning via hypervector embeddings in transformer-like architectures for tasks like commonsense reasoning, and (2) Hopfield-net dynamics enabling associative long-term memory and attractor-driven cognitive features.\nWe outline how ActPC-Geom combines few-shot learning with online weight updates, enabling deliberative thinking and seamless symbolic-subsymbolic reasoning.

Recently, vision Mamba have shown excellent ability in efficiently capturing long-range dependencies. Drawing inspiration from this, we propose a novel edge detector with Mamba, termed EDMB, to efficiently generate high-quality multi-granularity edges. In EDMB, Mamba is combined with a global-local architecture, therefore it can focus on both global information and fine-grained cues. The fine-grained cues play a crucial role in edge detection, but are usually ignored by ordinary Mamba. We design a novel decoder to construct learnable Gaussian distributions by fusing global features and fine-grained features. And the multi-grained edges are generated by sampling from the distributions. In order to make multi-granularity edges applicable to single-label data, we introduce Evidence Lower Bound loss to supervise the learning of the distributions. On the multi-label dataset BSDS500, our proposed EDMB achieves competitive single-granularity ODS 0.837 and multi-granularity ODS 0.851 without multi-scale test or extra PASCAL-VOC data. Remarkably, EDMB can be extended to single-label datasets such as NYUDv2 and BIPED. The source code is available at https://github.com/Li-yachuan/EDMB.",

These systems can now generate high-quality responses that are accurate and coherent across a wide range of topics and tasks. However, spoken dialogue systems still lag behind in terms of naturalness. They tend to produce robotic interactions, with issues such as slow response times, overly generic or cautious replies, and a lack of natural rhythm and fluid turn-taking. This shortcoming is largely due to the over-reliance on the traditional cascaded design, which involve separate, sequential components, as well as the use of text as an intermediate representation. This paper propose a real-time, textless spoken dialogue generation model (RTTL-DG) that aims to overcome these challenges. Our system enables fluid turn-taking and generates responses with minimal delay by processing streaming spoken conversation directly. Additionally, our model incorporates backchannels, filters, laughter, and other paralinguistic signals, which are often absent in cascaded dialogue systems, to create more natural and human-like interactions.

An increasing number of services have sprung up which offer LLMs for various tasks via APIs. Different LLMs demonstrate expertise in different domains of queries (e.g., text classification queries). Meanwhile, LLMs of different scales, complexity, and performance are priced diversely. Driven by this observation, a growing number of researchers are investigating the LLM ensemble strategy with a focus on cost-effectiveness, aiming to decrease overall usage costs while enhancing performance. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing works addresses the problem, i.e., how to find an LLM ensemble subject to a cost budget, which maximizes the ensemble performance.\nIn this paper, we formalize the performance of an ensemble of models (LLMs) using the notion of prediction accuracy which we formally define. We develop an approach for aggregating responses from multiple LLMs to enhance ensemble performance. Building on this, we formulate the ensemble selection problem as that of selecting a set of LLMs subject to a cost budget such that the overall prediction accuracy is maximized. We theoretically establish the non-decreasing and non-submodular properties of the prediction accuracy function and provide evidence that the Optimal Ensemble Selection problem is likely to be NP-hard. Subsequently, we apply dynamic programming and propose an algorithm called ThriftLLM. We prove that ThriftLLM achieves a near-optimal approximation guarantee.

        "abstract": "Recently, there has been a growing demand for conversational speech synthesis (CSS) that generates more natural speech by considering the conversational context. To address this, we introduce JELLY, a novel CSS framework that integrates emotion recognition and context reasoning for generating appropriate speech in conversation by fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) with multiple partial LoRA modules. We propose an Emotion-aware Q-former encoder, which enables the LLM to perceive emotions in speech. The encoder is trained to align speech emotions with text, utilizing datasets of emotional speech. The entire model is then fine-tuned with conversational speech data to infer emotional context for generating emotionally appropriate speech in conversation. Our experimental results demonstrate that JELLY excels in emotional context modeling, synthesizing speech that naturally aligns with conversation, while mitigating the scarcity of emotional conversational speech datasets.",

However, previous works have shown a gap between the ability of LLMs and the practical demands of hardware description language (HDL) engineering. This gap includes differences in how engineers phrase questions and hallucinations in the code generated. To address these challenges, we introduce HaVen, a novel LLM framework designed to mitigate hallucinations and align Verilog code generation with the practices of HDL engineers. HaVen tackles hallucination issues by proposing a comprehensive taxonomy and employing a chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism to translate symbolic modalities (e.g. truth tables, state diagrams, etc.) into accurate natural language descriptions. Furthermore, HaVen bridges this gap by using a data augmentation strategy. It synthesizes high-quality instruction-code pairs that match real HDL engineering practices. Our experiments demonstrate that HaVen significantly improves the correctness of Verilog code generation, outperforming state-of-the-art LLM-based Verilog generation methods on VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmark.

Our goal is to simplify crown design and minimize the tediousness of making manual adjustments while still ensuring the highest level of accuracy and consistency. To this end, we present a new end- to-end deep learning approach, coined Dental Mesh Completion (DMC), to generate a crown mesh conditioned on a point cloud context. The dental context includes the tooth prepared to receive a crown and its surroundings, namely the two adjacent teeth and the three closest teeth in the opposing jaw. We formulate crown generation in terms of completing this point cloud context. A feature extractor first converts the input point cloud into a set of feature vectors that represent local regions in the point cloud. The set of feature vectors is then fed into a transformer to predict a new set of feature vectors for the missing region (crown). Subsequently, a point reconstruction head, followed by a multi-layer perceptron, is used to predict a dense set of points with normals. Finally, a differentiable point-to-mesh layer serves to reconstruct the crown surface mesh. We compare our DMC method to a graph-based convolutional neural network which learns to deform a crown mesh from a generic crown shape to the target geometry. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which attains an average of 0.062 Chamfer http://Distance.The code is available at:https://github.com/Golriz-code/DMC.gi",

Jailbreak attacks are red teaming methods that aim to bypass safety mechanisms and discover MLLMs' potential risks. Existing MLLMs' jailbreak methods often bypass the model's safety mechanism through complex optimization methods or carefully designed image and text prompts. Despite achieving some progress, they have a low attack success rate on commercial closed-source MLLMs. Unlike previous research, we empirically find that there exists a Shuffle Inconsistency between MLLMs' comprehension ability and safety ability for the shuffled harmful instruction. That is, from the perspective of comprehension ability, MLLMs can understand the shuffled harmful text-image instructions well. However, they can be easily bypassed by the shuffled harmful instructions from the perspective of safety ability, leading to harmful responses. Then we innovatively propose a text-image jailbreak attack named SI-Attack. Specifically, to fully utilize the Shuffle Inconsistency and overcome the shuffle randomness, we apply a query-based black-box optimization method to select the most harmful shuffled inputs based on the feedback of the toxic judge model. A series of experiments show that SI-Attack can improve the attack's performance on three benchmarks. In particular, SI-Attack can obviously improve the attack success rate for commercial MLLMs such as GPT-4o or Claude-3.5-Sonnet.",

Query inconsistency produces unstable masks of different objects in the middle of the video.

To address these issues, we propose the Multi-context Temporal Consistency Module (MTCM), which consists of an Aligner and a Multi-Context Enhancer (MCE). The Aligner removes noise from queries and aligns them to achieve query consistency. The MCE predicts text-relevant queries by considering multi-context.

        "abstract": "Transformer has been extensively explored for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, transformer poses challenges in terms of speed and memory usage because of its quadratic computational complexity. Recently, the Mamba model has emerged as a promising approach, which has strong long-distance modeling capabilities while maintaining a linear computational complexity. However, representing the HSI is challenging for the Mamba due to the requirement for an integrated spatial and spectral understanding. To remedy these drawbacks, we propose a novel HSI classification model based on a Mamba model, named MambaHSI, which can simultaneously model long-range interaction of the whole image and integrate spatial and spectral information in an adaptive manner. Specifically, we design a spatial Mamba block (SpaMB) to model the long-range interaction of the whole image at the pixel-level. Then, we propose a spectral Mamba block (SpeMB) to split the spectral vector into multiple groups, mine the relations across different spectral groups, and extract spectral features. Finally, we propose a spatial-spectral fusion module (SSFM) to adaptively integrate spatial and spectral features of a HSI. To our best knowledge, this is the first image-level HSI classification model based on the Mamba. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse HSI datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model for HSI classification. This reveals the great potential of Mamba to be the next-generation backbone for HSI models.

Language interfaces, particularly those powered by Large Language Models (LLM) and Vision Language Models (VLM), hold significant promise in this context, as they can interpret visual scenes and correlate them with semantic information. However, such interfaces are also known for their hallucinated predictions. In addition, language instructions provided by humans can also be ambiguous and lack precise details about specific locations, objects, or actions, exacerbating the hallucination issue. In this work, we introduce Seeing with Partial Certainty (SwPC) - a framework designed to measure and align uncertainty in VLM-based place recognition, enabling the model to recognize when it lacks confidence and seek assistance when necessary. This framework is built on the theory of conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees on place recognition while minimizing requests for human help in complex indoor environment settings. Through experiments on the widely used richly-annotated scene dataset Matterport3D, we show that SwPC significantly increases the success rate and decreases the amount of human intervention required relative to the prior art. SwPC can be utilized with any VLMs directly without requiring model fine-tuning, offering a promising, lightweight approach to uncertainty modeling that complements and scales alongside the expanding capabilities of foundational models.",

Our approach begins by identifying the core capabilities required for the target domain and designing a comprehensive evaluation suite aligned with these needs. We then analyze the effectiveness of key post-training stages, including continual pretraining, instruction tuning, and preference alignment. Building on these insights, we propose an effective training recipe centered on a novel preference data distillation method, which leverages process signals from a generative reward model. The resulting model, Llama-Fin, achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of financial tasks.

However, the annotation of concepts for visual recognition tasks requires extensive expert knowledge and labor, constraining the broad adoption of CBMs. Recent approaches have leveraged the knowledge of large language models to construct concept bottlenecks, with multimodal models like CLIP subsequently mapping image features into the concept feature space for classification. Despite this, the concepts produced by language models can be verbose and may introduce non-visual attributes, which hurts accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we investigate to avoid these issues by constructing CBMs directly from multimodal models. To this end, we adopt common words as base concept vocabulary and leverage auxiliary unlabeled images to construct a Vision-to-Concept (V2C) tokenizer that can explicitly quantize images into their most relevant visual concepts, thus creating a vision-oriented concept bottleneck tightly coupled with the multimodal model. This leads to our V2C-CBM which is training efficient and interpretable with high accuracy. Our V2C-CBM has matched or outperformed LLM-supervised CBMs on various visual classification benchmarks, validating the efficacy of our approach.",

However, ensuring their generalization remains challenging, especially with static training environments. Additionally, DRL models lack transparency, making it difficult to guarantee safety in all scenarios, particularly those not seen during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a method that combines DRL with Curriculum Learning for autonomous driving. Our approach uses a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent and a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn safe driving in the CARLA simulator. The agent is trained using two-fold curriculum learning, progressively increasing environment difficulty and incorporating a collision penalty in the reward function to promote safety. This method improves the agent's adaptability and reliability in complex environments, and understand the nuances of balancing multiple reward components from different feedback signals in a single scalar reward function.

Existing methods evict tokens based on their positions or importance scores, but position-based strategies can miss crucial information outside predefined regions, while those relying on global importance scores resulting in strong regional biases, limiting the KV cache's overall context retention and potentially impairing the performance of LLMs on complex tasks. Our wavelet analysis reveals that as tokens approach the end of sequence, their contributions to generation gradually increase and tends to diverge more from neighboring tokens, indicating a smooth transition with increasing complexity and variability from distant to nearby context. Motivated by this observation, we propose TreeKV, an intuitive, training-free method that employs a tree structure for smooth cache compression. TreeKV maintains a fixed cache size, allowing LLMs to deliver high-quality output even in long text scenarios. Unlike most compression methods, TreeKV is applicable to both the generation and prefilling stages. It consistently surpasses all baseline models in language modeling tasks on PG19 and OpenWebText2, allowing LLMs trained with short context window to generalize to longer window with a 16x cache reduction. On the Longbench benchmark, TreeKV achieves the best performance with only 6\\% of the budget at optimal efficiency.",

We developed a systematic approach that organizes videos into a hierarchical tree structure and incorporates self-revision mechanisms to ensure high-quality QA pairs. Each QA pair in LongViTU features: 1) long-term context (average certificate length of 4.6 minutes); 2) rich knowledge and condensed reasoning (commonsense, causality, planning, etc.); and 3) explicit timestamp labels for relevant events. LongViTU also serves as a benchmark for instruction following in long-form and streaming video understanding. We evaluate the open-source state-of-the-art long video understanding model, LongVU, and the commercial model, Gemini-1.5-Pro, on our benchmark. They achieve GPT-4 scores of 49.9 and 52.3, respectively, underscoring the substantial challenge posed by our benchmark. Further supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on LongVU led to performance improvements of 12.0% on our benchmark, 2.2% on the in-distribution (ID) benchmark EgoSchema, 1.0%, 2.2% and 1.2% on the out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks VideoMME (Long), WorldQA and OpenEQA, respectively. These outcomes demonstrate LongViTU's high data quality and robust OOD generalizability.",

One significant application of LLMs is in tackling software engineering challenges, particularly in resolving real-world tasks on GitHub by fixing code based on the issues reported by the users. However, many current approaches rely on proprietary LLMs, which limits reproducibility, accessibility, and transparency. The critical components of LLMs for addressing software engineering issues and how their capabilities can be effectively enhanced remain unclear. To address these challenges, we introduce SWE-Fixer, a novel open-source LLM designed to effectively and efficiently resolve GitHub issues. SWE-Fixer comprises two essential modules: a code file retrieval module and a code editing module. The retrieval module employs BM25 along with a lightweight LLM model to achieve coarse-to-fine file retrieval. Subsequently, the code editing module utilizes the other LLM model to generate patches for the identified files. Then, to mitigate the lack of publicly available datasets, we compile an extensive dataset that includes 110K GitHub issues along with their corresponding patches, and train the two modules of SWE-Fixer separately. We assess our approach on the SWE-Bench Lite and Verified benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models with scores of 23.3% and 30.2%, respectively. These outcomes highlight the efficacy of our approach. We will make our model, dataset, and code publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/SWE-Fixer.",

        "abstract": "The programming landscape is nowadays being reshaped by the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) able to automate code-related tasks related to code implementation (e.g., code completion) and comprehension (e.g., code summarization). Such a paradigm shift comes with a number of implications related to how software will be written, maintained, and evolved. Also, these LLMs are extremely expensive to train, posing questions on their sustainability over time. Given their training cost, their ability to generalize, namely their ability to work on task instances different from those on which they have been trained, is an aspect worth being investigated. Previous work already showed that transformer models can successfully support code completion in a cross-project setting. However, it is unclear whether LLM are able to generalize to inputs having lengths not seen during training. For example, it is known that training a model on short instances allows to substantially reduce the training cost. However, the extent to which such a model would provide good performance on sequences having lengths not seen during training is not known. Many recent works in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tackled this problem in the context of decoder-only LLMs, i.e., xPOS and ALiBi. To assess if these solutions extend to encoder-decoder LLMs usually adopted in the code-related tasks, we present a large empirical study evaluating this generalization property of these and other encoding schemes proposed in the literature, namely Sinusoidal, xPOS, ALiBi, and T5. We found that none of these solutions successfully generalize to unseen lengths and that the only safe solution is to ensure the representativeness in the training set of all lengths likely to be encountered at inference time.",

Despite this promise, challenges such as the manual design of reward functions and low sample efficiency in complex environments continue to impede the development of safe and effective driving policies. To tackle these issues, we introduce LearningFlow, an innovative automated policy learning workflow tailored to urban driving. This framework leverages the collaboration of multiple large language model (LLM) agents throughout the RL training process. LearningFlow includes a curriculum sequence generation process and a reward generation process, which work in tandem to guide the RL policy by generating tailored training curricula and reward functions. Particularly, each process is supported by an analysis agent that evaluates training progress and provides critical insights to the generation agent. Through the collaborative efforts of these LLM agents, LearningFlow automates policy learning across a series of complex driving tasks, and it significantly reduces the reliance on manual reward function design while enhancing sample efficiency. Comprehensive experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator, along with comparisons with other existing methods, to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate that LearningFlow excels in generating rewards and curricula. It also achieves superior performance and robust generalization across various driving tasks, as well as commendable adaptation to different RL algorithms.",

Our method explicitly grounds VQA tasks to video fragments in four steps: entailment tree construction, video-language entailment verification, tree reasoning, and dynamic tree expansion. A vital benefit of the method is its generalizability to current video and image-based VLMs across reasoning types. To support fair evaluation, we devise a de-biasing procedure based on large-language models that rewrites VQA benchmark answer sets to enforce model reasoning.

In this work, we investigate memorization from an architectural lens by analyzing how attention modules at different layers impact its memorization and generalization performance. Using attribution techniques, we systematically intervene in the LLM architecture by bypassing attention modules at specific blocks while keeping other components like layer normalization and MLP transformations intact. We provide theorems analyzing our intervention mechanism from a mathematical view, bounding the difference in layer outputs with and without our attributions. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that attention modules in deeper transformer blocks are primarily responsible for memorization, whereas earlier blocks are crucial for the models generalization and reasoning capabilities. We validate our findings through comprehensive experiments on different LLM families (Pythia and GPTNeo) and five benchmark datasets. Our insights offer a practical approach to mitigate memorization in LLMs while preserving their performance, contributing to safer and more ethical deployment in real world applications.",

To ease this limitation, we introduce a novel and efficient diffusion model named Diffusion Model for Pansharpening by Inferring Residual Inference (ResPanDiff), which significantly reduces the number of diffusion steps without sacrificing the performance to tackle pansharpening task. In ResPanDiff, we innovatively propose a Markov chain that transits from noisy residuals to the residuals between the LRMS and HRMS images, thereby reducing the number of sampling steps and enhancing performance. Additionally, we design the latent space to help model extract more features at the encoding stage, Shallow Cond-Injection~(SC-I) to help model fetch cond-injected hidden features with higher dimensions, and loss functions to give a better guidance for the residual generation task. enabling the model to achieve superior performance in residual generation. Furthermore, experimental evaluations on pansharpening datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior outcomes compared to recent state-of-the-art~(SOTA) techniques, requiring only 15 sampling steps, which reduces over $90\\%$ step compared with the benchmark diffusion models.

Currently, the state-of-the-art methods in MIG are primarily adapter-based. However, these methods necessitate retraining a new adapter each time a more advanced model is released, resulting in significant resource consumption. A methodology named Depth-Driven Decoupled Instance Synthesis (3DIS) has been introduced, which decouples MIG into two distinct phases: 1) depth-based scene construction and 2) detail rendering with widely pre-trained depth control models. The 3DIS method requires adapter training solely during the scene construction phase, while enabling various models to perform training-free detail rendering. Initially, 3DIS focused on rendering techniques utilizing U-Net architectures such as SD1.5, SD2, and SDXL, without exploring the potential of recent DiT-based models like FLUX. In this paper, we present 3DIS-FLUX, an extension of the 3DIS framework that integrates the FLUX model for enhanced rendering capabilities. Specifically, we employ the FLUX.1-Depth-dev model for depth map controlled image generation and introduce a detail renderer that manipulates the Attention Mask in FLUX's Joint Attention mechanism based on layout information. This approach allows for the precise rendering of fine-grained attributes of each instance. Our experimental results indicate that 3DIS-FLUX, leveraging the FLUX model, outperforms the original 3DIS method, which utilized SD2 and SDXL, and surpasses current state-of-the-art adapter-based methods in terms of both performance and image quality.

Next, we propose ADRCM fine-tuning, a novel fine-tuning recipe that establishes mappings across different documents and relations, enhancing the model's contextual understanding and cross-sentence inference capabilities. Finally, during the inference, a biomedical-specific RAG approach, named CUI RAG, is designed to leverage CUIs as indexes for entities, narrowing the retrieval scope and enriching the relevant document contexts.

While significant advancements have been made in generating code reviews, the automated assessment of these reviews remains less explored, with existing approaches and metrics often proving inaccurate. Current metrics, such as BLEU, primarily rely on lexical similarity between generated and reference reviews. However, such metrics tend to underestimate reviews that articulate the expected issues in ways different from the references. In this paper, we explore how semantic similarity between generated and reference reviews can enhance the automated assessment of code reviews. We first present a benchmark called \\textit{GradedReviews}, which is constructed by collecting real-world code reviews from open-source projects, generating reviews using state-of-the-art approaches, and manually assessing their quality. We then evaluate existing metrics for code review assessment using this benchmark, revealing their limitations. To address these limitations, we propose two novel semantic-based approaches for assessing code reviews. The first approach involves converting both the generated review and its reference into digital vectors using a deep learning model and then measuring their semantic similarity through Cosine similarity. The second approach generates a prompt based on the generated review and its reference, submits this prompt to ChatGPT, and requests ChatGPT to rate the generated review according to explicitly defined criteria. Our evaluation on the \\textit{GradedReviews} benchmark indicates that the proposed semantic-based approaches significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art metrics in assessing generated code review, improving the correlation coefficient between the resulting scores and human scores from 0.22 to 0.47.",

Although existing methods produce high-quality outputs, they often fail to faithfully preserve the individual's identity. In this paper, we propose a personalized face restoration method, FaceMe, based on a diffusion model. Given a single or a few reference images, we use an identity encoder to extract identity-related features, which serve as prompts to guide the diffusion model in restoring high-quality and identity-consistent facial images. By simply combining identity-related features, we effectively minimize the impact of identity-irrelevant features during training and support any number of reference image inputs during inference. Additionally, thanks to the robustness of the identity encoder, synthesized images can be used as reference images during training, and identity changing during inference does not require fine-tuning the model. We also propose a pipeline for constructing a reference image training pool that simulates the poses and expressions that may appear in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our FaceMe can restore high-quality facial images while maintaining identity consistency, achieving excellent performance and robustness.",

However, their inference efficiency has been a notable concern, as the increasing length of multimodal contexts leads to quadratic complexity. Token compression techniques, which reduce the number of visual tokens, have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing computational costs. Yet, these approaches have struggled to keep pace with the rapid advancements in MLLMs, especially the AnyRes strategy in the context of high-resolution image understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel token compression method, GlobalCom$^2$, tailored for high-resolution MLLMs that receive both the thumbnail and multiple crops. GlobalCom$^2$ treats the tokens derived from the thumbnail as the ``commander'' of the entire token compression process, directing the allocation of retention ratios and the specific compression for each crop. In this way, redundant tokens are eliminated while important local details are adaptively preserved to the highest extent feasible. Empirical results across 10 benchmarks reveal that GlobalCom$^2$ achieves an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art token compression methods with LLaVA-NeXT-7B/13B models.

To investigate this, we analyze a recently published model in Science by Vong et al.,which is trained on longitudinal, egocentric images of a single child paired with transcribed parental speech. We introduce a training-free framework that can discover visual concept neurons hidden in the model's internal representations. Our findings show that these neurons can classify objects outside its original vocabulary. Furthermore, we compare the visual representations in infant-like models with those in moder computer vision models, such as CLIP or ImageNet pre-trained model, highlighting key similarities and differences.

However, CNNs often fail to capture long-range dependencies within the complex patterns of the muzzle. The transformers handle these challenges. This inspired us to fuse the strengths of CNNs and transformers in muzzle-based cattle identification. Addition and concatenation have been the most commonly used techniques for feature fusion. However, addition fails to preserve discriminative information, while concatenation results in an increase in dimensionality. Both methods are simple operations and cannot discover the relationships or interactions between fusing features. This research aims to overcome the issues faced by addition and concatenation. This research introduces a novel approach called Multi-Head Attention Feature Fusion (MHAFF) for the first time in cattle identification. MHAFF captures relations between the different types of fusing features while preserving their originality. The experiments show that MHAFF outperformed addition and concatenation techniques and the existing cattle identification methods in accuracy on two publicly available cattle datasets. MHAFF demonstrates excellent performance and quickly converges to achieve optimum accuracy of 99.88% and 99.52% in two cattle datasets simultaneously.",

Our approach uses fine-tuning on a pre-trained T5-small model, employing specially created datasets tailored to educational needs.

However, prior research works have predominantly focused on enhancing Far-OOD performance, while potentially compromising Near-OOD efficacy, as observed from our pilot study. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy to enhance zero-shot OOD detection performances for both Far-OOD and Near-OOD scenarios by innovatively harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) and VLMs. Our approach first exploit an LLM to generate superclasses of the ID labels and their corresponding background descriptions followed by feature extraction using CLIP. We then isolate the core semantic features for ID data by subtracting background features from the superclass features. The refined representation facilitates the selection of more appropriate negative labels for OOD data from a comprehensive candidate label set of WordNet, thereby enhancing the performance of zero-shot OOD detection in both scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce novel few-shot prompt tuning and visual prompt tuning to adapt the proposed framework to better align with the target distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, with an improvement of up to 2.9% in AUROC and a reduction of up to 12.6% in FPR95. Additionally, our method exhibits superior robustness against covariate shift across different domains, further highlighting its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.",

Notably, some methods perform well for RGB-D cameras but suffer significant degradation in rendering quality for monocular cameras. In this paper, we present Scaffold-SLAM, which delivers simultaneous localization and high-quality photorealistic mapping across monocular, stereo, and RGB-D cameras. We introduce two key innovations to achieve this state-of-the-art visual quality. First, we propose Appearance-from-Motion embedding, enabling 3D Gaussians to better model image appearance variations across different camera poses. Second, we introduce a frequency regularization pyramid to guide the distribution of Gaussians, allowing the model to effectively capture finer details in the scene. Extensive experiments on monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets demonstrate that Scaffold-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in photorealistic mapping quality, e.g., PSNR is 16.76% higher in the TUM RGB-D datasets for monocular cameras.",

A key challenge for the user then, is to identify not only when an LLM is the right choice of solver, and the appropriate LLM to call for a given synthesis task, but also the right way to call it. A non-expert user who makes the wrong choice, incurs a cost both in terms of results (number of tasks solved, and the time it takes to solve them) and financial cost, if using a closed-source language model via a commercial API. We frame this choice as an online learning problem. We use a multi-armed bandit algorithm to select which symbolic solver, or LLM and prompt combination to deploy in order to maximize a given reward function (which may prioritize solving time, number of synthesis tasks solved, or financial cost of solving). We implement an instance of this approach, called CYANEA, and evaluate it on synthesis queries from the literature in ranking function synthesis, from the syntax-guided synthesis competition, and fresh, unseen queries generated from SMT problems.

However, current approaches do not focus on the efficient extraction of programming-language-specific sub-models. In this work, we explore the idea of efficiently deriving coding-specific sub-models through unstructured pruning (i.e., Wanda). We investigate the impact of different domain-specific calibration datasets on pruning outcomes across three distinct domains and extend our analysis to extracting four language-specific sub-models: Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. We are the first to efficiently extract programming-language-specific sub-models using appropriate calibration datasets while maintaining acceptable accuracy w.r.t. full models. We are also the first to provide analytical evidence that domain-specific tasks activate distinct regions within LLMs, supporting the creation of specialized sub-models through unstructured pruning.

In this position paper, we believe that transformers have the potential to read research papers that propose algorithms with formal proofs and translate these proofs into verifiable code. We leverage transformers to first build a formal structure of the proof using the original text from the paper, and then to handle the tedious, low-level aspects of proofs that are often omitted by humans. We argue that this approach can significantly reduce the barrier to formal verification.

Current alignment strategies, including adaptive training and inference-time methods, have demonstrated potential in this area. However, these approaches still struggle to balance deployment complexity and capability across various tasks and difficulties. In this work, we introduce the Streaming Distribution Induce Aligner (Stream Aligner), a novel alignment paradigm that combines efficiency with enhanced performance in various tasks throughout the generation process. Stream Aligner achieves dynamic sentence-level correction by using a small model to learn the preferences of the suffix sentence, iteratively correcting the suffix sentence output by the upstream model, and then using the corrected sentence to replace the suffix sentence in subsequent generations. Compared to Aligner, our experiments demonstrate that Stream Aligner reduces reliance on the capabilities of additional models, enhances the reasoning abilities of LLMs, and decreases latency during user interaction. Specifically, Stream Aligner-2B model has achieved an improvement of 76.1% in helpfulness, 36.0% in harmlessness on the tested Llama2-70B-chat model, and Stream Aligner-8B has achieved an improvement of 3.5% on the math ability of the tested Llama3-70B-Instruct model.",

In this context, the target model is a high-quality but computationally expensive diffusion model. We propose various drafting strategies, including a simple and effective approach that does not require training a draft model and is applicable out of the box to any diffusion model.

This paper introduces SemanticLens, a universal explanation method for neural networks that maps hidden knowledge encoded by components (e.g., individual neurons) into the semantically structured, multimodal space of a foundation model such as CLIP. In this space, unique operations become possible, including (i) textual search to identify neurons encoding specific concepts, (ii) systematic analysis and comparison of model representations, (iii) automated labelling of neurons and explanation of their functional roles, and (iv) audits to validate decision-making against requirements. Fully scalable and operating without human input, SemanticLens is shown to be effective for debugging and validation, summarizing model knowledge, aligning reasoning with expectations (e.g., adherence to the ABCDE-rule in melanoma classification), and detecting components tied to spurious correlations and their associated training data. By enabling component-level understanding and validation, the proposed approach helps bridge the \"trust gap\" between AI models and traditional engineered systems.

Most existing time series generation models are typically designed to generate data from one specified domain.

In this paper, we propose a multi-domain time series diffusion model with domain prompts, named TimeDP. In TimeDP, we utilize a time series semantic prototype module which defines time series prototypes to represent time series basis, each prototype vector serving as \"word\" representing some elementary time series feature. A prototype assignment module is applied to extract the extract domain specific prototype weights, for learning domain prompts as generation condition. During sampling, we extract \"domain prompt\" with few-shot samples from the target domain and use the domain prompts as condition to generate time series samples. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines to provide the state-of-the-art in-domain generation quality and strong unseen domain generation capability.",

We introduce LongProc (Long Procedural Generation), a new benchmark that requires both the integration of highly dispersed information and long-form generation. LongProc consists of six diverse procedural generation tasks, such as extracting structured information from HTML pages into a TSV format and executing complex search procedures to create travel plans. These tasks challenge LCLMs by testing their ability to follow detailed procedural instructions, synthesize and reason over dispersed information, and generate structured, long-form outputs (up to 8K tokens). Furthermore, as these tasks adhere to deterministic procedures and yield structured outputs, they enable reliable rule-based evaluation. We evaluate 17 LCLMs on LongProc across three difficulty levels, with maximum numbers of output tokens set at 500, 2K, and 8K. Notably, while all tested models claim a context window size above 32K tokens, open-weight models typically falter on 2K-token tasks, and closed-source models like GPT-4o show significant degradation on 8K-token tasks. Further analysis reveals that LCLMs struggle to maintain long-range coherence in long-form generations. These findings highlight critical limitations in current LCLMs and suggest substantial room for improvement. Data and code available at: https://princeton-pli.github.io/LongProc",

In this paper, we introduce Zero-1-to-G, a novel approach that addresses this problem by enabling direct single-view generation on Gaussian splats using pretrained 2D diffusion models. Our key insight is that Gaussian splats, a 3D representation, can be decomposed into multi-view images encoding different attributes. This reframes the challenging task of direct 3D generation within a 2D diffusion framework, allowing us to leverage the rich priors of pretrained 2D diffusion models. To incorporate 3D awareness, we introduce cross-view and cross-attribute attention layers, which capture complex correlations and enforce 3D consistency across generated splats. This makes Zero-1-to-G the first direct image-to-3D generative model to effectively utilize pretrained 2D diffusion priors, enabling efficient training and improved generalization to unseen objects. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and in-the-wild datasets demonstrate superior performance in 3D object generation, offering a new approach to high-quality 3D generation.",

We analyze our loss mathematically and prove that it admits local convergence guarantees, unlike most existing relativistic losses. Second, our new loss allows us to discard all ad-hoc tricks and replace outdated backbones used in common GANs with modern architectures. Using StyleGAN2 as an example, we present a roadmap of simplification and modernization that results in a new minimalist baseline -- R3GAN.

In this work, we propose an alternative approach to enhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of temporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of high-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that high-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression models. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped high-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression blocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a cross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained low-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the remaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks shows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while increasing temporal compression compared to direct extensions of existing video tokenizers. Furthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video diffusion model for high-quality video generation with a reduced token budget.",

Our method trains a set of expert diffusion models over partitions of the dataset, each in full isolation from one another. At inference time, the experts ensemble through a lightweight router. We show that the ensemble collectively optimizes the same objective as a single model trained over the whole dataset. This means we can divide the training burden among a number of \"compute islands,\" lowering infrastructure costs and improving resilience to localized GPU failures. Decentralized diffusion models empower researchers to take advantage of smaller, more cost-effective and more readily available compute like on-demand GPU nodes rather than central integrated systems. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet and LAION Aesthetics, showing that decentralized diffusion models FLOP-for-FLOP outperform standard diffusion models.

Our results demonstrate that, despite minimal inductive biases, autoregressive pre-training leads to competitive performance across all benchmarks. Finally, we find that scaling our video models results in similar scaling curves to those seen in language models, albeit with a different rate. More details at https://brjathu.github.io/toto/",

        "abstract": "Solving inverse problems with the reverse process of a diffusion model represents an appealing avenue to produce highly realistic, yet diverse solutions from incomplete and possibly noisy measurements, ultimately enabling uncertainty quantification at scale. However, because of the intractable nature of the score function of the likelihood term (i.e., $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}_t} p(\\mathbf{y} | \\mathbf{x}_t)$), various samplers have been proposed in the literature that use different (more or less accurate) approximations of such a gradient to guide the diffusion process towards solutions that match the observations. In this work, I consider two sampling algorithms recently proposed under the name of Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Pseudo-inverse Guided Diffusion Model (PGDM), respectively. In DSP, the guidance term used at each step of the reverse diffusion process is obtained by applying the adjoint of the modeling operator to the residual obtained from a one-step denoising estimate of the solution. On the other hand, PGDM utilizes a pseudo-inverse operator that originates from the fact that the one-step denoised solution is not assumed to be deterministic, rather modeled as a Gaussian distribution. Through an extensive set of numerical examples on two geophysical inverse problems (namely, seismic interpolation and seismic inversion), I show that two key aspects for the success of any measurement-guided diffusion process are: i) our ability to re-parametrize the inverse problem such that the sought after model is bounded between -1 and 1 (a pre-requisite for any diffusion model); ii) the choice of the training dataset used to learn the implicit prior that guides the reverse diffusion process. Numerical examples on synthetic and field datasets reveal that PGDM outperforms DPS in both scenarios at limited additional cost.",

        "abstract": "Audio super-resolution is challenging owing to its ill-posed nature. Recently, the application of diffusion models in audio super-resolution has shown promising results in alleviating this challenge. However, diffusion-based models have limitations, primarily the necessity for numerous sampling steps, which causes significantly increased latency when synthesizing high-quality audio samples. In this paper, we propose FLowHigh, a novel approach that integrates flow matching, a highly efficient generative model, into audio super-resolution. We also explore probability paths specially tailored for audio super-resolution, which effectively capture high-resolution audio distributions, thereby enhancing reconstruction quality. The proposed method generates high-fidelity, high-resolution audio through a single-step sampling process across various input sampling rates. The experimental results on the VCTK benchmark dataset demonstrate that FLowHigh achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio super-resolution, as evaluated by log-spectral distance and ViSQOL while maintaining computational efficiency with only a single-step sampling process.",

        "abstract": "Proposed in Hyvärinen (2005), score matching is a parameter estimation procedure that does not require computation of distributional normalizing constants. In this work we utilize the geometric median of means to develop a robust score matching procedure that yields consistent parameter estimates in settings where the observed data has been contaminated. A special appeal of the proposed method is that it retains convexity in exponential family models. The new method is therefore particularly attractive for non-Gaussian, exponential family graphical models where evaluation of normalizing constants is intractable. Support recovery guarantees for such models when contamination is present are provided. Additionally, support recovery is studied in numerical experiments and on a precipitation dataset. We demonstrate that the proposed robust score matching estimator performs comparably to the standard score matching estimator when no contamination is present but greatly outperforms this estimator in a setting with contamination.",

By leveraging deep learning to construct pathloss patterns from geographical maps, an accurate digital replica of the transmission environment could be established with less computational overhead and lower prediction error compared to traditional model-driven techniques. While existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods predominantly rely on convolutional architectures, this paper introduces a hybrid transformer-convolution model, termed RadioTransformer, to enhance the accuracy of radio map prediction. The proposed model features a multi-scale transformer-based encoder for efficient feature extraction and a convolution-based decoder for precise pixel-level image reconstruction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves prediction accuracy, and over a 30% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) is achieved compared to typical SOTA approaches.",

        "abstract": "This paper explores ideas and provides a potential roadmap for the development and evaluation of physics-specific large-scale AI models, which we call Large Physics Models (LPMs). These models, based on foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - trained on broad data - are tailored to address the demands of physics research. LPMs can function independently or as part of an integrated framework. This framework can incorporate specialized tools, including symbolic reasoning modules for mathematical manipulations, frameworks to analyse specific experimental and simulated data, and mechanisms for synthesizing theories and scientific literature. We begin by examining whether the physics community should actively develop and refine dedicated models, rather than relying solely on commercial LLMs. We then outline how LPMs can be realized through interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in physics, computer science, and philosophy of science. To integrate these models effectively, we identify three key pillars: Development, Evaluation, and Philosophical Reflection. Development focuses on constructing models capable of processing physics texts, mathematical formulations, and diverse physical data. Evaluation assesses accuracy and reliability by testing and benchmarking. Finally, Philosophical Reflection encompasses the analysis of broader implications of LLMs in physics, including their potential to generate new scientific understanding and what novel collaboration dynamics might arise in research. Inspired by the organizational structure of experimental collaborations in particle physics, we propose a similarly interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to building and refining Large Physics Models. This roadmap provides specific objectives, defines pathways to achieve them, and identifies challenges that must be addressed to realise physics-specific large scale AI models.",
