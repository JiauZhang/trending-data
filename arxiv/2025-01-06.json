Tool-use, Microsoft co-pilot/office integration, and OpenAIs Altera are just a few examples of increased autonomy, data access, and execution capabilities.

In addition, any implementation of AAM needs to face the challenges posed by inherently dynamic and uncertain human-inhabited spaces robustly. Nevertheless, the employment of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) is an endearing task that promises to enhance significantly today's logistics and emergency response capabilities. To tackle these challenges, we present a probabilistic and neuro-symbolic architecture to encode legal frameworks and expert knowledge over uncertain spatial relations and noisy perception in an interpretable and adaptable fashion. More specifically, we demonstrate Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a system architecture that links geospatial and sensory data with declarative, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) to reason over the agent's state space and its legality. As a result, ProMis generates Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML), which quantify the agent's belief that a set of mission conditions is satisfied across its navigation space. Extending prior work on ProMis' reasoning capabilities and computational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based vision models. Hence, our experiments underpin the application of ProMis with multi-modal input data and how our method applies to many important AAM scenarios.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in the latent space to enable faster training and inference while achieving results comparable to those of the state-of-the-art diffusion methods. We perform experiments on the HumanML3D, HumanAct12 benchmarks and demonstrate that a remarkably simple GAN in the latent space achieves a FID of 0.482 with more than 91% in FLOPs reduction compared to latent diffusion model.

However, while scientific machine learning (SciML) has shown promise, most studies are constrained to simple geometries, leaving complex, real-world scenarios underexplored. This study addresses this gap by benchmarking diverse SciML models, including neural operators and vision transformer-based foundation models, for fluid flow prediction over intricate geometries. Using a high-fidelity dataset of steady-state flows across various geometries, we evaluate the impact of geometric representations -- Signed Distance Fields (SDF) and binary masks -- on model accuracy, scalability, and generalization. Central to this effort is the introduction of a novel, unified scoring framework that integrates metrics for global accuracy, boundary layer fidelity, and physical consistency to enable a robust, comparative evaluation of model performance. Our findings demonstrate that foundation models significantly outperform neural operators, particularly in data-limited scenarios, and that SDF representations yield superior results with sufficient training data. Despite these advancements, all models struggle with out-of-distribution generalization, highlighting a critical challenge for future SciML applications. By advancing both evaluation methodologies and modeling capabilities, this work paves the way for robust and scalable ML solutions for fluid dynamics across complex geometries.",

While human preference alignment has shown extraordinary opportunities, expensive labeling challenges adherence to scaling law. Language model self-critique, as an alternative to using human-labeled reasoning data, is questioned with its inherited biases. This work addresses these challenges by distilling the LLM's own reasoning processes into synthetic behavioral data, eliminating the need for manual labeling of intermediate steps. Building on this concept, we propose Distillation-Reinforcement-Reasoning (DRR), a three-step framework that leverages the LLM's inherent behaviors as external feedback by first generating behavioral data using the Reasoner (LLM) to reflect its reasoning capabilities, then training a lightweight discriminative reward model (DM) on behavioral data, and finally deploying the DM at inference time to assist the Reasoner's decision-making. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the DRR framework outperforms self-critique approaches without relying on additional complex data annotation. Benefiting from lightweight design, ease of replication, and adaptability, DRR is applicable to a wide range of LLM-centric tasks.",

Instead of optimizing the entire model, we identify and selectively fine-tune a small subset of layers most susceptible to overfitting, applying sharpness-aware minimization to these layers while freezing the rest of the model. Our method consistently enhances both clean and adversarial accuracy over baseline approaches.

Proposing theories, designing experiments to test them, and then revising them based on data are fundamental to scientific discovery. Despite the significant promise of LLM-based scientific agents, no benchmarks systematically test LLM's ability to propose scientific models, collect experimental data, and revise them in light of new data. We introduce BoxingGym, a benchmark with 10 environments for systematically evaluating both experimental design (e.g. collecting data to test a scientific theory) and model discovery (e.g. proposing and revising scientific theories). To enable tractable and quantitative evaluation, we implement each environment as a generative probabilistic model with which a scientific agent can run interactive experiments. These probabilistic models are drawn from various real-world scientific domains ranging from psychology to ecology. To quantitatively evaluate a scientific agent's ability to collect informative experimental data, we compute the expected information gain (EIG), an information-theoretic quantity which measures how much an experiment reduces uncertainty about the parameters of a generative model. A good scientific theory is a concise and predictive explanation. Therefore, to quantitatively evaluate model discovery, we ask a scientific agent to explain their model and then assess whether this explanation enables another scientific agent to make reliable predictions about this environment. In addition to this explanation-based evaluation, we compute standard model evaluation metrics such as prediction errors. We find that current LLMs, such as GPT-4o, struggle with both experimental design and model discovery. We find that augmenting the LLM-based agent with an explicit statistical model does not reliably improve these results.",

This paper introduces a unifying framework inspired by mutual information, which proposes a new loss function with flexible priors. By carefully specifying these priors, we demonstrate that many existing algorithms, such as SimPO, TDPO, SparsePO, and others, can be derived from our framework. This unification offers a clearer and more structured approach, allowing researchers to understand the relationships between different DPO variants better. We aim to simplify the landscape of DPO algorithms, making it easier for the research community to gain insights and foster further advancements in LLM alignment.

While a great deal of work in the field uses internal representations to interpret model behavior, these representations are inaccessible when given solely black-box access through an API. In this paper, we extract features of LLMs in a black-box manner by using follow-up prompts and taking the probabilities of different responses as representations to train reliable predictors of model behavior. We demonstrate that training a linear model on these low-dimensional representations produces reliable and generalizable predictors of model performance at the instance level (e.g., if a particular generation correctly answers a question). Remarkably, these can often outperform white-box linear predictors that operate over a model's hidden state or the full distribution over its vocabulary. In addition, we demonstrate that these extracted features can be used to evaluate more nuanced aspects of a language model's state. For instance, they can be used to distinguish between a clean version of GPT-4o-mini and a version that has been influenced via an adversarial system prompt that answers question-answering tasks incorrectly or introduces bugs into generated code. Furthermore, they can reliably distinguish between different model architectures and sizes, enabling the detection of misrepresented models provided through an API (e.g., identifying if GPT-3.5 is supplied instead of GPT-4o-mini).",

This is challenging because even for the same signal, the optimal INRs can vary significantly depending on their initializations. To tackle this, we propose EquiGen, a framework that can generate new INRs from limited data. The core idea is that functionally similar networks can be transformed into one another through weight permutations, forming an equivariance group. By projecting these weights into an equivariant latent space, we enable diverse generation within these groups, even with few examples. EquiGen implements this through an equivariant encoder trained via contrastive learning and smooth augmentation, an equivariance-guided diffusion process, and controlled perturbations in the equivariant subspace. Experiments on 2D image and 3D shape INR datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively generates diverse INR weights while preserving their functional properties in few-shot scenarios.",

To address it, we propose ICPC (In-context Prompt Compression), a novel and scalable prompt compression method that adaptively reduces the prompt length. The key idea of ICPC is to calculate the probability of each word appearing in the prompt using encoders and calculate information carried by each word through the information function, which effectively reduces the information loss during prompt compression and increases the speed of compression.

Existing concept erasure methods achieve superior results in preventing the production of erased concept from prompts, but typically perform poorly in preventing undesired editing. To address this issue, we propose an Anti-Editing Concept Erasure (ACE) method, which not only erases the target concept during generation but also filters out it during editing. Specifically, we propose to inject the erasure guidance into both conditional and the unconditional noise prediction, enabling the model to effectively prevent the creation of erasure concepts during both editing and generation. Furthermore, a stochastic correction guidance is introduced during training to address the erosion of unrelated concepts. We conducted erasure editing experiments with representative editing methods (i.e., LEDITS++ and MasaCtrl) to erase IP characters, and the results indicate that our ACE effectively filters out target concepts in both types of edits. Additional experiments on erasing explicit concepts and artistic styles further demonstrate that our ACE performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

Our resource-constrained TAP equation demonstrates how architectural, training, and contextual constraints interact to shape model capabilities through phase transitions in semantic space. We prove through experiments with three different language models that capacities emerge through discrete transitions guided by constraint interactions and path-dependent exploration. This framework provides a theoretical basis for understanding emergence in language models and guides the development of architectures that can guide capability emergence.",

However, hour-long video understanding, spanning over one hour and containing tens of thousands of visual frames, remains under-explored because of 1) challenging long-term video analyses, 2) inefficient large-model approaches, and 3) lack of large-scale benchmark datasets. Among them, in this paper, we focus on building a large-scale hour-long long video benchmark, HLV-1K, designed to evaluate long video understanding models. HLV-1K comprises 1009 hour-long videos with 14,847 high-quality question answering (QA) and multi-choice question asnwering (MCQA) pairs with time-aware query and diverse annotations, covering frame-level, within-event-level, cross-event-level, and long-term reasoning tasks. We evaluate our benchmark using existing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate its value for testing deep long video understanding capabilities at different levels and for various tasks. This includes promoting future long video understanding tasks at a granular level, such as deep understanding of long live videos, meeting recordings, and movies.",

Recently, the dual-attention mechanism has been devoted to this area due to its ability to strengthen the detection process. However, most existing methods directly fuse attentional cross-modality features under a manual-mandatory fusion paradigm without considering the inherent discrepancy between the RGB and depth, which may lead to a reduction in performance. Moreover, the long-range dependencies derived from global and local information make it difficult to leverage a unified efficient fusion strategy. Hence, in this paper, we propose the GL-DMNet, a novel dual mutual learning network with global-local awareness. Specifically, we present a position mutual fusion module and a channel mutual fusion module to exploit the interdependencies among different modalities in spatial and channel dimensions. Besides, we adopt an efficient decoder based on cascade transformer-infused reconstruction to integrate multi-level fusion features jointly. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed GL-DMNet performs better than 24 RGB-D SOD methods, achieving an average improvement of ~3% across four evaluation metrics compared to the second-best model (S3Net).

By harnessing the bidirectional capabilities of BART the framework then identifies malicious packets among these predictions.

We combined Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE) and provable security theory with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning(PEFT) to propose an efficient and secure inference scheme for LLMs. More specially, we focus on pre-trained LLMs who rely on open-sourced base model and then fine-tuned with the private datasets by LoRA. This is a popular road-map for Vertical Domain Models such as LawGPT and BenTsao. We use two key technologies below. Firstly, we divide the whole model into the public part and the private part. The weights of public part are publicly accessible(e.g. the open-sourced base model) while the private part needs to be protected(e.g. the LoRA matrices). In this way, the overhead brought by computing on private data can be greatly reduced. Secondly, we propose a general method to transform a linear layer into another one which provides security against model extraction attacks and preserves its original functionality, which denotes as Private Linear Layer(PLL). Then we use this method on the LoRA matrices to make sure that the server protects their private weights without restricting the user's input. We also show that the difficulty of performing model extraction attacks for PLL can be generalized to the well-known hard problem Learning with Errors(LWE). Combing this method with FHE, we can protect user's input at the same time. This transform method can be applied to any linear layer to gain an extra protection against model extraction attacks. In this paper, we use the open-source model ChatGLM2-6B as the base model which is fine-tuned by LoRA. Experimental results show the inference efficiency of our scheme reaches 1.61s/token which shows that the scheme has good practicality.",

First, we build a translation demonstration retrieval module based on LLM's embedding to retrieve top-k semantic-similar translation demonstrations from aligned parallel translation corpus. Rather than using other embedding models for semantic demonstration retrieval, we build a hybrid demonstration retrieval module based on the embedding layer of the deployed LLM to build better input representation for retrieving more semantic-related translation demonstrations. Then, to ensure better semantic consistency between source inputs and target outputs, we force the deployed LLM itself to generate multiple output candidates in the target language with the help of translation demonstrations and rerank these candidates. Besides, to better evaluate the effectiveness of our AFSP framework on the latest language and extend the research boundary of neural machine translation, we construct a high-quality diplomatic Chinese-English parallel dataset that consists of 5,528 parallel Chinese-English sentences. Finally, extensive experiments on the proposed diplomatic Chinese-English parallel dataset and the United Nations Parallel Corpus (Chinese-English part) show the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed AFSP.",

To enhance the spatiotemporal feature extraction capabilities of VidFormer, we incorporate temporal-spatial attention mechanisms tailored for both 3DCNN and Transformer. Additionally, we design a module to facilitate information exchange and fusion between the 3DCNN and Transformer.

However, there is still a large gap between open-sourced LLMs and commercial models like the GPT series. In this paper, we focus on improving the agent generalization capabilities of LLMs via instruction tuning. We first observe that the existing agent training corpus exhibits satisfactory results on held-in evaluation sets but fails to generalize to held-out sets. These agent-tuning works face severe formatting errors and are frequently stuck in the same mistake for a long while. We analyze that the poor generalization ability comes from overfitting to several manual agent environments and a lack of adaptation to new situations. They struggle with the wrong action steps and can not learn from the experience but just memorize existing observation-action relations. Inspired by the insight, we propose a novel AgentRefine framework for agent-tuning. The core idea is to enable the model to learn to correct its mistakes via observation in the trajectory. Specifically, we propose an agent synthesis framework to encompass a diverse array of environments and tasks and prompt a strong LLM to refine its error action according to the environment feedback. AgentRefine significantly outperforms state-of-the-art agent-tuning work in terms of generalization ability on diverse agent tasks. It also has better robustness facing perturbation and can generate diversified thought in inference. Our findings establish the correlation between agent generalization and self-refinement and provide a new paradigm for future research.",

        "abstract": "Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a fundamental psychological capability that allows humans to understand and interpret the mental states of others. Humans infer others' thoughts by integrating causal cues and indirect clues from broad contextual information, often derived from past interactions. In other words, human ToM heavily relies on the understanding about the backgrounds and life stories of others. Unfortunately, this aspect is largely overlooked in existing benchmarks for evaluating machines' ToM capabilities, due to their usage of short narratives without global backgrounds. In this paper, we verify the importance of understanding long personal backgrounds in ToM and assess the performance of LLMs in such realistic evaluation scenarios. To achieve this, we introduce a novel benchmark, CharToM-QA, comprising 1,035 ToM questions based on characters from classic novels. Our human study reveals a significant disparity in performance: the same group of educated participants performs dramatically better when they have read the novels compared to when they have not. In parallel, our experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including the very recent o1 model, show that LLMs still perform notably worse than humans, despite that they have seen these stories during pre-training. This highlights the limitations of current LLMs in capturing the nuanced contextual information required for ToM reasoning.",

To leverage the various capabilities of these encoders, recent studies incorporate multiple encoders within a single VLM, leading to a considerable increase in computational cost. In this paper, we present Mixture-of-Visual-Encoder Knowledge Distillation (MoVE-KD), a novel framework that distills the unique proficiencies of multiple vision encoders into a single, efficient encoder model. Specifically, to mitigate conflicts and retain the unique characteristics of each teacher encoder, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and mixture-of-experts (MoEs) to selectively activate specialized knowledge based on input features, enhancing both adaptability and efficiency. To regularize the KD process and enhance performance, we propose an attention-based distillation strategy that adaptively weighs the different visual encoders and emphasizes valuable visual tokens, reducing the burden of replicating comprehensive but distinct features from multiple teachers. Comprehensive experiments on popular VLMs, such as LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT, validate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be released.",

Most existing FAS methods are formulated as binary classification tasks, providing confidence scores without interpretation. They exhibit limited generalization in out-of-domain scenarios, such as new environments or unseen spoofing types. In this work, we introduce a multimodal large language model (MLLM) framework for FAS, termed Interpretable Face Anti-Spoofing (I-FAS), which transforms the FAS task into an interpretable visual question answering (VQA) paradigm. Specifically, we propose a Spoof-aware Captioning and Filtering (SCF) strategy to generate high-quality captions for FAS images, enriching the model's supervision with natural language interpretations. To mitigate the impact of noisy captions during training, we develop a Lopsided Language Model (L-LM) loss function that separates loss calculations for judgment and interpretation, prioritizing the optimization of the former. Furthermore, to enhance the model's perception of global visual features, we design a Globally Aware Connector (GAC) to align multi-level visual representations with the language model. Extensive experiments on standard and newly devised One to Eleven cross-domain benchmarks, comprising 12 public datasets, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

Generative models are therefore essentials, especially for generating adverse weather conditions for specific driving scenarios.

In this paper, we first investigate the underlying mechanism by analyzing the changes in safety alignment related features before and after fine-tuning. Then, we propose a fixed safety module calculated by safety data and a task-specific initialization for trainable parameters in low-rank adaptations, termed Safety-alignment preserved Low-Rank Adaptation (SaLoRA). Unlike previous LoRA methods and their variants, SaLoRA enables targeted modifications to LLMs without disrupting their original alignments.

To provide cost-effective LLM inference with relaxed latency constraints, extensive research has focused on expanding GPU memory by leveraging the host memory. However, LLM inference engines that utilize the host memory often face underutilization of GPU compute units, as a considerable portion of inference time is spent in loading the model onto the GPU via host-GPU interconnect. To tackle these challenges of the host memory offloading for LLM, we introduce HybridServe, an LLM inference system with activation checkpointing based on activation caching. The activation cache stores activation checkpoints generated during intermediate inference stages, allowing the fast recomputation of KV cache while model parameters are transferred to GPU from host memory. Unlike conventional methods that recompute the KV cache from scratch using token IDs, the activation cache allows bypassing projection and FFN operations. To balance between the activation recomputation and parameter loading overhead, this study proposes a KV-activation hybrid caching scheme which finds the best ratio of the key-value and activation caches to adjust the recomputation time. Our system achieves 2.19x throughput improvement over the state-of-the-art prior work for offloading both model weights and KV cache.",

To address these challenges, we propose the following innovations: 1)the Mixture of Emotion Experts (MoEE) model, which decouples six fundamental emotions to enable the precise synthesis of both singular and compound emotional states; 2)the DH-FaceEmoVid-150 dataset, specifically curated to include six prevalent human emotional expressions as well as four types of compound emotions, thereby expanding the training potential of emotion-driven models. Furthermore, to enhance the flexibility of emotion control, we propose an emotion-to-latents module that leverages multimodal inputs, aligning diverse control signals-such as audio, text, and labels-to ensure more varied control inputs as well as the ability to control emotions using audio alone. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that the MoEE framework, in conjunction with the DH-FaceEmoVid-150 dataset, excels in generating complex emotional expressions and nuanced facial details, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Next, we demonstrate that an adversary can generate query-independent token sequences we call ``confounder gadgets'' that, when added to any query, cause LLM routers to send the query to a strong LLM.\nOur quantitative evaluation shows that this attack is successful both in white-box and black-box settings against a variety of open-source and commercial routers, and that confounding queries do not affect the quality of LLM responses. Finally, we demonstrate that gadgets can be effective while maintaining low perplexity, thus perplexity-based filtering is not an effective defense. We finish by investigating alternative defenses.",

To address these limitations, we propose Segment-Level Direct Preference Optimization (SDPO), which focuses on specific key segments within interactions to optimize multi-turn agent behavior while minimizing training noise. Evaluations on the SOTOPIA benchmark demonstrate that SDPO-tuned agents consistently outperform both existing DPO-based methods and proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o, underscoring SDPO's potential to advance the social intelligence of LLM-based agents. We release our code and data at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/SDPO.",

However, most existing methods focus on isolated safety flaws, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic defenses and uncover complex vulnerabilities efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose Auto-RT, a reinforcement learning framework that automatically explores and optimizes complex attack strategies to effectively uncover security vulnerabilities through malicious queries. Specifically, we introduce two key mechanisms to reduce exploration complexity and improve strategy optimization: 1) Early-terminated Exploration, which accelerate exploration by focusing on high-potential attack strategies; and 2) Progressive Reward Tracking algorithm with intermediate downgrade models, which dynamically refine the search trajectory toward successful vulnerability exploitation. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs demonstrate that, by significantly improving exploration efficiency and automatically optimizing attack strategies, Auto-RT detects a boarder range of vulnerabilities, achieving a faster detection speed and 16.63\\% higher success rates compared to existing methods.",

While pre-trained foundation models have made considerable progress in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), their application to time series analysis has been hindered by data scarcity. Although several large language model (LLM)-based methods have been proposed for time series forecasting, time series captioning is under-explored in the context of LLMs. In this paper, we introduce TSLM, a novel time series language model designed specifically for time series captioning. TSLM operates as an encoder-decoder model, leveraging both text prompts and time series data representations to capture subtle temporal patterns across multiple phases and generate precise textual descriptions of time series inputs. TSLM addresses the data scarcity problem in time series captioning by first leveraging an in-context prompting synthetic data generation, and second denoising the generated data via a novel cross-modal dense retrieval scoring applied to time series-caption pairs. Experimental findings on various time series captioning datasets demonstrate that TSLM outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches from multiple data modalities by a significant margin.",

For complex tasks such as diagnostic report generation, deep learning models require not only domain-specific image-caption datasets but also the incorporation of relevant general knowledge to provide contextual accuracy. Existing approaches exhibit inherent limitations: specialized models excel in capturing domain-specific details but lack generalization, while vision-language models (VLMs) built on large language models (LLMs) leverage general knowledge but struggle with domain-specific adaptation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel agent-enhanced model collaboration framework, which we called \\textbf{MoColl}, designed to effectively integrate domain-specific and general knowledge. Specifically, our approach is to decompose complex image captioning tasks into a series of interconnected question-answer subtasks. A trainable visual question answering (VQA) model is employed as a specialized tool to focus on domain-specific visual analysis, answering task-specific questions based on image content. Concurrently, an LLM-based agent with general knowledge formulates these questions and synthesizes the resulting question-answer pairs into coherent captions. Beyond its role in leveraging the VQA model, the agent further guides its training to enhance its domain-specific capabilities. Experimental results on radiology report generation validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in the quality of generated reports.",

Given the dynamic nature of user preferences and the uncertainty of LLM response performance, it is crucial to design efficient online learning algorithms to identify optimal LLM responses (i.e., high-quality responses that also meet user preferences). Most existing online algorithms adopt a centralized approach and fail to leverage explicit user preferences for more efficient and personalized LLM response identification. In contrast, this paper introduces \\textit{MACO} (\\underline{M}ulti-\\underline{A}gent \\underline{C}onversational \\underline{O}nline Learning for Adaptive LLM Response Identification): 1) The online LLM response identification process is accelerated by multiple local agents (such as smartphones), while enhancing data privacy; 2) A novel conversational mechanism is proposed to adaptively conduct conversations for soliciting user preferences (e.g., a preference for a humorous tone over a serious one in generated responses), so to minimize uncertainty in preference estimation. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that \\cadi\\ is near-optimal regarding cumulative regret. Additionally, \\cadi\\ offers reduced communication costs and computational complexity by eliminating the traditional, computing-intensive ``G-optimal design\" found in previous works.

However, most existing UAV-OD algorithms rely on manually designed components, which require extensive tuning. End-to-end models that do not depend on such manually designed components are mainly designed for natural images, which are less effective for UAV imagery. To address such challenges, this paper proposes an efficient detection transformer (DETR) framework tailored for UAV imagery, i.e., UAV-DETR. The framework includes a multi-scale feature fusion with frequency enhancement module, which captures both spatial and frequency information at different scales. In addition, a frequency-focused down-sampling module is presented to retain critical spatial details during down-sampling. A semantic alignment and calibration module is developed to align and fuse features from different fusion paths. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach across various UAV imagery datasets. On the VisDrone dataset, our method improves AP by 3.1\\% and $\\text{AP}_{50}$ by 4.2\\% over the baseline. Similar enhancements are observed on the UAVVaste dataset.

Moreover, existing methods still have an inaccurate pitch and low speaker adaptation quality, there is a significant disparity in pitch between the source and target speaker style domains. As a result, the models tend to generate speech with hoarseness, posing challenges in achieving high-quality voice conversion. In this study, we propose CycleFlow, a novel VC approach that leverages cycle consistency in conditional flow matching (CFM) for speaker timbre adaptation training on non-parallel data. Furthermore, we design a Dual-CFM based on VoiceCFM and PitchCFM to generate speech and improve speaker pitch adaptation quality.

We conduct extensive evaluations across six diverse language model families of varying parameter sizes, including LLaMA3, Gemma2, Phi3, and GPT-4, to demonstrate the robustness of the attack, achieving significantly higher attack success rates (~44%) compared to existing methods.

To further augment robotic capabilities, we introduce the Free Anchor View (FAV) space, which provides flexible perspectives to enhance observation and analysis. The FAV space mitigates motion modeling ambiguity, removes physical constraints in confined environments, and significantly improves the robot's generalization and adaptability across various tasks and settings. To address the prohibitive costs and labor intensity of acquiring multi-camera observations, we present a data engine pipeline that integrates a generative model with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS). This pipeline leverages the generative model's robust generalization capabilities and the spatial constraints provided by 4DGS, enabling an iterative enhancement of data quality and diversity, thus creating a data flywheel effect that effectively narrows the sim-to-real gap.

There is also growing interest in adapting this capability to multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Given that MLLMs handle more complex data semantics across different modalities, it is intuitively more challenging to implement multimodal slow-thinking systems.\nTo address this issue, in this paper, we explore a straightforward approach by fine-tuning a capable MLLM with a small amount of textual long-form thought data, resulting in a multimodal slow-thinking system, Virgo (Visual reasoning with long thought). We find that these long-form reasoning processes, expressed in natural language, can be effectively transferred to MLLMs. Moreover, it seems that such textual reasoning data can be even more effective than visual reasoning data in eliciting the slow-thinking capacities of MLLMs. While this work is preliminary, it demonstrates that slow-thinking capacities are fundamentally associated with the language model component, which can be transferred across modalities or domains. This finding can be leveraged to guide the development of more powerful slow-thinking reasoning systems. We release our resources at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Virgo.",

This novel joint modeling of ASR and SLU improves SLU performance significantly over just using SLU optimization. We further improve the performance by aligning the acoustic embeddings of this model with the semantically richer BERT model. Our proposed knowledge transfer strategy makes use of a bag-of-entity prediction layer on the aligned embeddings and the output of this is used to condition the RNN-T based SLU decoding.

In particular, the driving factor is detected from time series using the VAE in an unsupervised-learning fashion and the extracted information is then used as the parameter input to the reservoir computer for anticipating the critical transition. We demonstrate the power of the unsupervised learning scheme using prototypical dynamical systems including the spatiotemporal Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system. The scheme can also be extended to scenarios where the target system is driven by several independent parameters or with partial state observations.",

        "abstract": "Following an analysis of existing AI-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), we reveal the selection criteria for determining which stocks qualify as AI-related are often opaque and rely on vague phrases and subjective judgments. This paper proposes a new, objective, data-driven approach using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify AI stocks by analyzing annual 10-K filings from 3,395 NASDAQ-listed firms between 2011 and 2023. This analysis quantifies each company's engagement with AI through binary indicators and weighted AI scores based on the frequency and context of AI-related terms. Using these metrics, we construct four AI stock indices-the Equally Weighted AI Index (AII), the Size-Weighted AI Index (SAII), and two Time-Discounted AI Indices (TAII05 and TAII5X)-offering different perspectives on AI investment. We validate our methodology through an event study on the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, demonstrating that companies with higher AI engagement saw significantly greater positive abnormal returns, with analyses supporting the predictive power of our AI measures. Our indices perform on par with or surpass 14 existing AI-themed ETFs and the Nasdaq Composite Index in risk-return profiles, market responsiveness, and overall performance, achieving higher average daily returns and risk-adjusted metrics without increased volatility. These results suggest our NLP-based approach offers a reliable, market-responsive, and cost-effective alternative to existing AI-related ETF products. Our innovative methodology can also guide investors, asset managers, and policymakers in using corporate data to construct other thematic portfolios, contributing to a more transparent, data-driven, and competitive approach.",
